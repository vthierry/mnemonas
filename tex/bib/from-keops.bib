                In the vertebrate retina, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) mediates inhibitory processes that shape the visual response and is also thought to have neurotrophic functions during retinal development. To investigate the role of GABAergic signaling at the beginning of visual experience, we used immunohistochemistry to compare the distribution of GABA, the two isoforms of glutamic acid decarboxylase GAD65/67, and the GABA receptor types A, B, and C, in neonate versus adult Octodon degus, a native South American rodent with diurnal-crepuscular activity and a high cone-to-rod ratio. In parallel, we used electroretinography to evaluate retinal functionality and to test the contribution of fast GABAergic transmission to light responses at both developmental stages. Neonate O. degus opened their eyes on postnatal day (P)0 and displayed an adult-like retinal morphology at this time. GABA, its biosynthetic sources, and receptors had a similar cellular distribution in neonates and adults, but labeling of the outer plexiform layer and of certain amacrine and ganglion cells was more conspicuous at P0. In neonates, retinal sensitivity was 10 times lower than in adults, responses to ultraviolet light could not be detected, and oscillatory potentials were reduced or absent. Blockade of GABA(A/C) receptors by bicuculline and TPMPA had no noticeable effect in neonates, while it significantly altered the electroretinogram response in adults. Conclusion: In spite of modest differences regarding retinal morphology and GABAergic expression, overall light response properties and GABAergic signaling are undeveloped in neonate O. degus compared to adults, suggesting that full retinal functionality requires a period of neural refinement under visual experience.

                Studies on processing in primary visual areas often use artificial stimuli such as bars or gratings. As a result, little is known about the properties of activity patterns for the natural stimuli processed by the visual system on a daily basis. Furthermore, in the cat, a well-studied model system for visual processing, most results are obtained from anesthetized subjects and little is known about neuronal activations in the alert animal. Addressing these issues, we measure local field potentials (lfp) and multiunit spikes in the primary visual cortex of awake cats. We compare changes in the lfp power spectra and multiunit firing rates for natural movies, movies with modified spatio-temporal correlations as well as gratings. The activity patterns elicited by drifting gratings are qualitatively and quantitatively different from those elicited by natural stimuli and this difference arises from both spatial as well as temporal properties of the stimuli. Furthermore, both local field potentials and multiunit firing rates are most sensitive to the second-order statistics of the stimuli and not to their higher-order properties. Finally, responses to natural movies show a large variability over time because of activity fluctuations induced by rapid stimulus motion. We show that these fluctuations are not dependent on the detailed spatial properties of the stimuli but depend on their temporal jitter. These fluctuations are important characteristics of visual activity under natural conditions and impose limitations on the readout of possible differences in mean activity levels.

Recent evidence obtained from transgenic mouse models suggests that soluble, nonfibrillar Aβ oligomers may induce synaptic failure early in AD. Despite their undoubted value, these transgenic models rely on genetic manipulations that represent the inherited and familial, but not the most abundant, sporadic form of AD. A nontransgenic animal model that still develops hallmarks of AD would be an important step toward understanding how sporadic AD is initiated. Here we show that starting between 12 and 36 mo of age, the rodent Octodon degus naturally develops neuropathological signs of AD, such as accumulation of Aβ oligomers and phosphorylated tau proteins. Moreover, age-related changes in Aβ oligomers and tau phosphorylation levels are correlated with decreases in spatial and object recognition memory, postsynaptic function, and synaptic plasticity. These findings validate O. degus as a suitable natural model for studying how sporadic AD may be initiated.}},

a population code that consists of combinations of spikes and silences. The
organism's view of the world, and in particular, its ability to distinguish

responses. On a single neuron level, distinguishable responses are produced
only when the stimuli differ along a small number of directions in the stimulus
space. It is unclear how this picture generalizes to a population of
interacting neurons encoding the same stimulus. Here we addressed this question
by inferring a distance measure on the stimulus space directly from the
recorded activity of 100 neurons in the salamander retina. In contrast to
previously used measures of stimulus similarity, the "retinal distance" tells
us precisely how distinguishable, given the noise in population neural
responses, a pair of stimulus clips is to the retina. We found that the retinal
distance strongly deviates from Euclidean, and indeed from any distance with a
static metric, yet it nevertheless has a simple structure that relies on a
small number of stimulus projections. By constructing a mathematical model for
the retinal distance we show that this non-Euclidean nature has important
consequences for decoding and inferring feature sensitivity of whole neural
populations.}},

                The central amygdala (CEA), a nucleus predominantly composed of GABAergic inhibitory neurons, is essential for fear conditioning. How the acquisition and expression of conditioned fear are encoded within CEA inhibitory circuits is not understood. Using in vivo electrophysiological, optogenetic and pharmacological approaches in mice, we show that neuronal activity in the lateral subdivision of the central amygdala (CEl) is required for fear acquisition, whereas conditioned fear responses are driven by output neurons in the medial subdivision (CEm). Functional circuit analysis revealed that inhibitory CEA microcircuits are highly organized and that cell-type-specific plasticity of phasic and tonic activity in the CEl to CEm pathway may gate fear expression and regulate fear generalization. Our results define the functional architecture of CEA microcircuits and their role in the acquisition and regulation of conditioned fear behaviour.

                The information generated by cone photoreceptors in the retina is compressed and transferred to higher processing centers through three distinct types of ganglion cells known as magno, parvo and konio cells. These ganglion cells, which travel from the retina to the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and then to the primary visual cortex, have different structural and functional characteristics, and are organized in distinct layers in the LGN and the primary visual cortex. Magno cells are large, have thick axons and usually collect input from many retinal cells. Parvo cells are smaller, with fine axons and less myelin than mango cells. Konio cells are diverse small cells with wide fields of input consisting of different cells types. The three cellular pathways also differ in function. Magno cells respond rapidly to changing stimuli, while parvo cells need time to respond. The distinct patterns of structure and function in these cells have provided an opportunity for clinical assessment of their function. Functional assessment of these cells is currently used in the field of ophthalmology where frequency-doubling technology perimetry selectively assesses the function of magno cells. Evidence has accrued that the three pathways show characteristic patterns of malfunctions in multiple sclerosis, schizophrenia, Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases, and several other disorders. The combination of behavioral assessment with other techniques, such as event related potentials and functional magnetic resonance imaging, seems to bear promising future clinical applications.

                The vertebrate retina generates a stack of about a dozen different movies that represent the visual world as dynamic neural images or movies. The stack is embodied as separate strata that span the inner plexiform layer (IPL). At each stratum, ganglion cell dendrites reach up to read out inhibitory interactions between three different amacrine cell classes that shape bipolar-to-ganglion cell transmission. The nexus of these five cell classes represents a functional module, a retinal 'hypercircuit', that is repeated across the surface of each of the dozen strata that span the depth of the IPL. Individual differences in the characteristics of each cell class at each stratum lead to the unique processing characteristics of each neural image throughout the stack. This review shows how the interactions between the morphological and physiological characteristics of each cell class generate many of the known retinal visual functions including motion detection, directional selectivity, local edge detection, looming detection, object motion and looming detection.

                An influential theory of visual processing asserts that retinal center-surround receptive fields remove spatial correlations in the visual world, producing ganglion cell spike trains that are less redundant than the corresponding image pixels. For bright, high-contrast images, this decorrelation would enhance coding efficiency in optic nerve fibers of limited capacity. We tested the central prediction of the theory and found that the spike trains of retinal ganglion cells were indeed decorrelated compared with the visual input. However, most of the decorrelation was accomplished not by the receptive fields, but by nonlinear processing in the retina. We found that a steep response threshold enhanced efficient coding by noisy spike trains and that the effect of this nonlinearity was near optimal in both salamander and macaque retina. These results offer an explanation for the sparseness of retinal spike trains and highlight the importance of treating the full nonlinear character of neural codes.

During normal viewing this is complicated by the presence of eye movements that continually scan the image across the retina, even during fixation. To detect moving objects, the brain must distinguish local motion within the scene from the global retinal image drift due to fixational eye movements. We have found that this process begins in the retina: a subset of retinal ganglion cells responds to motion in the receptive field centre, but only if the wider surround moves with a different trajectory. This selectivity for differential motion is independent of direction, and can be explained by a model of retinal circuitry that invokes pooling over nonlinear interneurons. The suppression by global image motion is probably mediated by polyaxonal, wide-field amacrine cells with transient responses. We show how a population of ganglion cells selective for differential motion can rapidly flag moving objects, and even segregate multiple moving objects.}},

    abstract = {{We previously established a functional pathway extending from the superficial layers of the superior colliculus (SC) through the inferior pulvinar (PI) to cortical area MT in the primate (Macaca mulatta). Here, we characterized the signals that this pathway conveys to cortex by recording from pulvinar neurons that we identified by microstimulation as receiving input from SC and/or projecting to MT. The basic properties of these ascending-path PI neurons resembled those of SC visual neurons. Namely, they had brisk responses to spots of light, inhibitory surrounds, and relatively large receptive fields that increased with eccentricity, as well as minimal presaccadic activity. Beyond these basic properties, there were two salient results regarding the modulatory and motion signals conveyed by this ascending pathway. First, the PI neurons appeared to convey only a subset of the modulations found in the SC: they exhibited saccadic suppression, the inhibition of activity at the time of the saccade, but did not clearly show the attentional enhancement of the visual response seen in SC. Second, directional selectivity was minimal in PI neurons belonging to the ascending path but was significantly more prominent in PI neurons receiving input from MT. This finding casts doubt on earlier assumptions that PI provides directionally selective signals to MT and instead suggests that PI derives its selectivity from MT. The identification of this pathway and its transmitted activity establishes the first functional pathway from brainstem to cortex through pulvinar and makes it possible to examine its contribution to cortical visual processing, perception, and action.}},

However, such overlaid information tends to obscure a user's field of view and thus impedes a user's real-world activities. This problem is especially critical when a user is wearing a head-mounted display. In this paper, we propose an information presentation mechanism for mobile AR systems by focusing on the user's gaze information and peripheral vision field. The gaze information is used to control the positions and the level-of-detail of the information overlaid on the user's field of view. We also propose a method for switching displayed information based on the difference in human visual perception between the peripheral and central visual fields. We develop a mobile AR system to test our proposed method consisting of a gaze-tracking system and a retinal imaging display. The eye-tracking system estimates whether the user's visual focus is on the information display area or not, and changes the information type from simple to detailed information accordingly.}},

    abstract = {{ What is optimal depends on computational tasks. Many recent works base optimality on information theoretical terms such as information transmission rates. This can be particularly revelant in the early stages of vision which are mainly concerned with transmitting information indiscriminately. We focus on the better known visual system to discuss optimal sensory coding, although coding in other sensory systems are expected to address similar concerns.  Consider a simplified visual input model, with, say, 1000x1000 pixels arranged in a regular grid at one byte per pixel and 20 images per second. It provides many megabytes/second of raw data. Given the information bottleneck in the long optic nerve from retina to thalamus and the limited firing rates (thus limited data capacity) of cortical neurons (see article SENSORY CODING AND INFORMATION TRANSMISSION), early vision can greatly benefit from a data encoding that reduces the data rate without significant information loss.

Subjectively, recognition of familiar objects and scenes appears to be virtually instantaneous, but measuring this processing time experimentally has proved difficult. Behavioural measures such as reaction times can be used, but these include not only visual processing but also the time required for response execution. However, event-related potentials (ERPs) can sometimes reveal signs of neural processing well before the motor output. Here we use a go/no-go categorization task in which subjects have to decide whether a previously unseen photograph, flashed on for just 20 ms, contains an animal. ERP analysis revealed a frontal negativity specific to no-go trials that develops roughly 150 ms after stimulus onset. We conclude that the visual processing needed to perform this highly demanding task can be achieved in under 150 ms.}},

    abstract = {{An ultimate goal of visual neuroscience is to understand the neural encoding of complex, everyday scenes. Yet most of our knowledge of neuronal receptive fields has come from studies using simple artificial stimuli (e.g., bars, gratings) that may fail to reveal the full nature of a neuron's actual response properties. Our goal was to compare the utility of artificial and natural stimuli for estimating receptive field (RF) models. Using extracellular recordings from simple type cells in cat A18, we acquired responses to three types of broadband stimulus ensembles: two widely used artificial patterns (white noise and short bars), and natural images. We used a primary dataset to estimate the spatiotemporal receptive field (STRF) with two hold-back datasets for regularization and validation. STRFs were estimated using an iterative regression algorithm with regularization and subsequently fit with a zero-memory nonlinearity. Each RF model (STRF and zero-memory nonlinearity) was then used in simulations to predict responses to the same stimulus type used to estimate it, as well as to other broadband stimuli and sinewave gratings. White noise stimuli often elicited poor responses leading to noisy RF estimates, while short bars and natural image stimuli were more successful in driving A18 neurons and producing clear RF estimates with strong predictive ability. Natural image-derived RF models were the most robust at predicting responses to other broadband stimulus ensembles that were not used in their estimation and also provided good predictions of tuning curves for sinewave gratings.}},

    abstract = {{Adaptation in the retina is thought to optimize the encoding of natural light
signals into sequences of spikes sent to the brain. However, adaptation also
entails computational costs: adaptive code is intrinsically ambiguous, because
output symbols cannot be trivially mapped back to the stimuli without the
knowledge of the adaptive state of the encoding neuron. It is thus important to
learn which statistical changes in the input do, and which do not, invoke
adaptive responses, and ask about the reasons for potential limits to
adaptation. We measured the ganglion cell responses in the tiger salamander
retina to controlled changes in the second (contrast), third (skew) and fourth
(kurtosis) moments of the light intensity distribution of spatially uniform
temporally independent stimuli. The skew and kurtosis of the stimuli were
chosen to cover the range observed in natural scenes. We quantified adaptation
in ganglion cells by studying two-dimensional linear-nonlinear models that
capture well the retinal encoding properties across all stimuli. We found that
the retinal ganglion cells adapt to contrast, but exhibit remarkably invariant
behavior to changes in higher-order statistics. Finally, by theoretically
analyzing optimal coding in LN-type models, we showed that the neural code can
maintain a high information rate without dynamic adaptation despite changes in
stimulus skew and kurtosis.}},

                Contrary to common wisdom, fixations are a dynamically rich behavior, composed of continual, miniature eye movements, of which microsaccades are the most salient component. Over the last few years, interest in these small movements has risen dramatically, driven by both neurophysiological and psychophysical results and by advances in techniques, analysis, and modeling of eye movements. The field has a long history but a significant portion of the earlier work has gone missing in the current literature, in part, as a result of the collapse of the field in the 1980s that followed a series of discouraging results. The present review compiles 60 years of work demonstrating the unique contribution of microsaccades to visual and oculomotor function. Specifically, the review covers the contribution of microsaccades to (1) the control of fixation position, (2) the reduction of perceptual fading and the continuity of perception, (3) the generation of synchronized visual transients, (4) visual acuity, (5) scanning of small spatial regions, (6) shifts of spatial attention, (7) resolving perceptual ambiguities in the face of multistable perception, as well as several other functions. The accumulated evidence demonstrates that microsaccades serve both perceptual and oculomotor goals and although in some cases their contribution is neither necessary nor unique, microsaccades are a malleable tool conveniently employed by the visual system.

A simplified anatomically based model of topographically and nontopographically projecting ("core" and "matrix") thalamic nuclei, and their differential connections with superficial, middle, and deep neocortical laminae, is described. Synapses in the model are activated and potentiated according to physiologically based rules. Features incorporated into the models include differential time courses of excitatory versus inhibitory postsynaptic potentials, differential axonal arborization of pyramidal cells versus interneurons, and different laminar afferent and projection patterns. Observation of the model's responses to static and time-varying inputs indicates that topographic "core" circuits operate to organize stored memories into natural similarity-based hierarchies, whereas diffuse "matrix" circuits give rise to efficient storage of time-varying input into retrievable sequence chains. Examination of these operations shows their relationships with well-studied algorithms for related functions, including categorization via hierarchical clustering, and sequential storage via hash- or scatter-storage. Analysis demonstrates that the derived thalamocortical algorithms exhibit desirable efficiency, scaling, and space and time cost characteristics. Implications of the hypotheses for central issues of perceptual reaction times and memory capacity are discussed. It is conjectured that the derived functions are fundamental building blocks recurrent throughout the neocortex, which, through combination, gives rise to powerful perceptual, motor, and cognitive mechanisms.}},

Nonetheless, the physiological properties of only a handful of retinal ganglion cell types have been studied in detail. Here we show, using a newly developed multielectrode array system for the large-scale recording of neural activity, the existence of a physiologically distinct population of ganglion cells in the primate retina with distinctive visual response properties. These cells, which we will refer to as upsilon cells, are characterized by large receptive fields, rapid and transient responses to light, and significant nonlinearities in their spatial summation. Based on the measured properties of these cells, we speculate that they correspond to the smooth/large radiate cells recently identified morphologically in the primate retina and may therefore provide visual input to both the lateral geniculate nucleus and the superior colliculus. We further speculate that the upsilon cells may be the primate retina's counterparts of the Y-cells observed in the cat and other mammalian species.}},

                We use saccades several times per second to move the fovea between points of interest and build an understanding of our visual environment. Recent behavioral experiments show evidence for the integration of pre- and postsaccadic information (even subliminally), the modulation of visual sensitivity, and the rapid reallocation of attention. The recent physiological literature has identified a characteristic modulation of neural responsiveness-perisaccadic reduction followed by a postsaccadic increase-that is found in many visual areas, but whose source is as yet unknown. This modulation seems optimal for reducing sensitivity during and boosting sensitivity between saccades, but no study has yet established a direct causal link between neural and behavioral changes.

    abstract = {{Retinal ganglion cells exhibit substantial correlated firing: a tendency to fire nearly synchronously at rates different than expected by chance. These correlations suggest that network interactions significantly shape the visual signal transmitted from the eye to the brain. This study describes the degree and structure of correlated firing among the major ganglion cell types in primate retina. Correlated firing among ON and OFF parasol, ON and OFF midget, and small bistratified cells, which together constitute roughly 75\% of the input to higher visual areas, was studied using large-scale multi-electrode recordings. Correlated firing in the presence of constant, spatially uniform illumination exhibited characteristic strength, time course and polarity within and across cell types. Pairs of nearby cells with the same light response polarity were positively correlated; cells with the opposite polarity were negatively correlated. The strength of correlated firing declined systematically with distance for each cell type, in proportion to the degree of receptive field overlap. The pattern of correlated firing across cell types was similar at photopic and scotopic light levels, although additional slow correlations were present at scotopic light levels. Similar results were also observed in two other retinal ganglion cell types. Most of these observations are consistent with the hypothesis that shared noise from photoreceptors is the dominant cause of correlated firing. Surprisingly, small bistratified cells, which receive ON input from S cones, fired synchronously with ON parasol and midget cells, which receive ON input primarily from L and M cones. Collectively, these results provide an overview of correlated firing across cell types in the primate retina, and constraints on the underlying mechanisms.}},

However, recent accounts of visual perception stress the role of recurrent interactions that start rapidly after the activation of V1. To study whether or not recurrent processes play a causal role in categorization, we applied fMRI-guided transcranial magnetic stimulation on early visual cortex (V1/V2) and lateral occipital cortex (LO) while the participants categorized natural images as containing animals or not. The results showed that V1/V2 contributed to categorization speed and to subjective perception during a long activity period before and after the contribution of LO had started. This pattern of results suggests that recurrent interactions in visual cortex between areas along the ventral stream and striate cortex play a causal role in categorization and perception of natural scenes.}},

This can be accomplished by making an eye movement to bring the object onto the fovea (overt attention) or by increased processing of visual information in neurons representing more peripheral regions of the visual field (covert attention). This review will examine two aspects of visual attention: the changes in neural responses within visual cortices due to the allocation of covert attention; and the neural activity in higher cortical areas involved in guiding the allocation of attention. The first section will highlight processes that occur during visual spatial attention and feature-based attention in cortical visual areas and several related models that have recently been proposed to explain this activity. The second section will focus on the parietofrontal network thought to be involved in targeting eye movements and allocating covert attention. It will describe evidence that the lateral intraparietal area, frontal eye field and superior colliculus are involved in the guidance of visual attention, and describe the priority map model, which is thought to operate in at least several of these areas.}},

This circuitry is described here in the context of a two-level model that distinguishes between feedforward and feedback connections. Embedded within this basic framework is a more complex organization. Within the strictly feedforward pathway, these circuits distribute unique combinations of magno-, parvo-, and koniocellular input from the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) to neurons in layers 2-4B. Their input is dependent on the extrastriate cortical areas they target. The local feedback connections from deep layers (5 and 6) arise from a diverse population of pyramidal neurons. Each type forms local connections with a unique relationship to more superficial layers. In the case of layer 6 neurons, these connections are closely related to layer 4 subdivisions receiving input from different functional streams.}},

Past theories have relied on the intralaminar nuclei as the sources of diffuse thalamocortical projections that could facilitate spread of activity across the cortex. A case is made for the presence of a matrix of superficially-projecting cells, not confined to the intralaminar nuclei but extending throughout the whole thalamus. These cells are distinguished by immunoreactivity for the calcium-binding protein, D28K calbindin, are found in all thalamic nuclei of primates and have increased numbers in some nuclei. They project to superficial layers of the cerebral cortex over relatively wide areas, unconstrained by architectonic boundaries. They generally receive subcortical inputs that lack the topographic order and physiological precision of the principal sensory pathways. Superimposed upon the matrix in certain nuclei only, is a core of cells distinguished by immunoreactivity for another calcium-binding protein, parvalbumin, These project in highly ordered fashion to middle layers of the cortex in an area-specific manner. They are innervated by subcortical inputs that are topographically precise and have readily identifiable physiological properties. The parvalbumin cells form the basis for sensory and other inputs that are to be used as a basis for perception. The calbindin cells, especially when recruited by corticothalamic connections, can form a basis for the engagement of multiple cortical areas and thalamic nuclei that is essential for the binding of multiple aspects of sensory experience into a single framework of consciousness.}},

information on the way to the cerebral cortex, but it has not been
until the last decade or so that the functional nature of this relay
has attracted significant attention. Whereas earlier views tended to
relegate thalamic function to a simple, machine-like relay process,
recent research, reviewed in this article, demonstrates complicated
circuitry and a rich array of membrane properties underlying the
thalamic relay. It is now clear that the thalamic relay does not have
merely a trivial function. Suggestions that the thalamic circuits and
cell properties only come into play during certain phases of sleep
to effectively disconnect the relay are correct as far as they go,
but they are incomplete, because they fail to take into account
interesting and variable properties of the relay that, we argue, occur
during normal waking behavior. Although the specific function of
the circuits and cellular properties of the thalamic relay for waking
behavior is far from clear, we offer two related hypotheses based
on recent experimental evidence. One is that the thalamus is not
used just to relay peripheral information from, for example, visual,
auditory, or cerebellar inputs, but that some thalamic nuclei are
arranged instead to relay information from one cortical area to
another. The second is that the thalamus is not a simple, passive
relay of information to cortex but instead is involved in many
dynamic processes that significantly alter the nature of the information
relayed to cortex.}},

    abstract = {{The lateral geniculate nucleus is the best understood thalamic relay and serves as a model for all thalamic relays. Only 5-10\% of the input to geniculate relay cells derives from the retina, which is the driving input. The rest is modulatory and derives from local inhibitory inputs, descending inputs from layer 6 of the visual cortex, and ascending inputs from the brainstem. These modulatory inputs control many features of retinogeniculate transmission. One such feature is the response mode, burst or tonic, of relay cells, which relates to the attentional demands at the moment. This response mode depends on membrane potential, which is controlled effectively by the modulator inputs. The lateral geniculate nucleus is a first\^{a}order relay, because it relays subcortical (i.e. retinal) information to the cortex for the first time. By contrast, the other main thalamic relay of visual information, the pulvinar region, is largely a higher\^{a}order relay, since much of it relays information from layer 5 of one cortical area to another. All thalamic relays receive a layer of modulatory input from cortex, but higher\^{a}order relays in addition receive a layer of driver input. Corticocortical processing may involve these corticothalamocortical entry routes to a far greater extent than previously appreciated. If so, the thalamus sits at an indispensable position for the modulation of messages involved in corticocortical processing.}},

Both response modes efficiently relay information to the cortex in behaving animals, but have markedly different consequences for information processing. The lateral geniculate nucleus, which is the thalamic relay of retinal information to cortex, provides a reasonable model for all of thalamus. Compared with burst mode, geniculate relay cells that are firing in tonic mode exhibit better linear summation, but have poorer detectability for visual stimuli. The switch between the response modes can be controlled by nonretinal, modulatory afferents to these cells, such as the feedback pathway from cortex.

                Precise spike coordination between the spiking activities of multiple neurons is suggested as an indication of coordinated network activity in active cell assemblies. Spike correlation analysis aims to identify such cooperative network activity by detecting excess spike synchrony in simultaneously recorded multiple neural spike sequences. Cooperative activity is expected to organize dynamically during behavior and cognition; therefore currently available analysis techniques must be extended to enable the estimation of multiple time-varying spike interactions between neurons simultaneously. In particular, new methods must take advantage of the simultaneous observations of multiple neurons by addressing their higher-order dependencies, which cannot be revealed by pairwise analyses alone. In this paper, we develop a method for estimating time-varying spike interactions by means of a state-space analysis. Discretized parallel spike sequences are modeled as multi-variate binary processes using a log-linear model that provides a well-defined measure of higher-order spike correlation in an information geometry framework. We construct a recursive Bayesian filter/smoother for the extraction of spike interaction parameters. This method can simultaneously estimate the dynamic pairwise spike interactions of multiple single neurons, thereby extending the Ising/spin-glass model analysis of multiple neural spike train data to a nonstationary analysis. Furthermore, the method can estimate dynamic higher-order spike interactions. To validate the inclusion of the higher-order terms in the model, we construct an approximation method to assess the goodness-of-fit to spike data. In addition, we formulate a test method for the presence of higher-order spike correlation even in nonstationary spike data, e.g., data from awake behaving animals. The utility of the proposed methods is tested using simulated spike data with known underlying correlation dynamics. Finally, we apply the methods to neural spike data simultaneously recorded from the motor cortex of an awake monkey and demonstrate that the higher-order spike correlation organizes dynamically in relation to a behavioral demand.

                Many current neurophysiological, psychophysical, and psychological approaches to vision rest on the idea that when we see, the brain produces an internal representation of the world. The activation of this internal representation is assumed to give rise to the experience of seeing. The problem with this kind of approach is that it leaves unexplained how the existence of such a detailed internal representation might produce visual consciousness. An alternative proposal is made here. We propose that seeing is a way of acting. It is a particular way of exploring the environment. Activity in internal representations does not generate the experience of seeing. The outside world serves as its own, external, representation. The experience of seeing occurs when the organism masters what we call the governing laws of sensorimotor contingency. The advantage of this approach is that it provides a natural and principled way of accounting for visual consciousness, and for the differences in the perceived quality of sensory experience in the different sensory modalities. Several lines of empirical evidence are brought forward in support of the theory, in particular: evidence from experiments in sensorimotor adaptation, visual "filling in," visual stability despite eye movements, change blindness, sensory substitution, and color perception.

                When human subjects suffer from a lesion to the primary visual cortex, they lose all visual percepts in the region of space that corresponds to the site of the lesion. However, they are still capable of responding to stimuli in this region when asked to 'guess' or to execute forced-choice motor commands related to these stimuli. This phenomenon, termed blindsight, is still only partly understood. Here, the possible roles of feedforward and feedback corticocortical connections in the visual brain in the understanding of blindsight are reviewed. What emerges is substantial evidence in favor of the theory that unconscious visuo-motor transformations, as in blindsight, may be executed in an entirely feedforward processing cycle, while visual awareness is critically dependent on feedback connections to the primary visual cortex.

For human cortex, I estimate the cost of individual spikes, then, from the known energy consumption of cortex, I establish how many neurons can be active concurrently. The cost of a single spike is high, and this severely limits, possibly to fewer than 1\%, the number of neurons that can be substantially active concurrently. The high cost of spikes requires the brain not only to use representational codes that rely on very few active neurons, but also to allocate its energy resources flexibly among cortical regions according to task demand. The latter constraint explains the investment in local control of hemodynamics, exploited by functional magnetic resonance imaging, and the need for mechanisms of selective attention.}},

I argue that visual cortex does not undertake multiple relatively independent analyses of the image from which it assembles a unified representation that can be interrogated about the what and where of the world. Instead, occipital cortex is organized so that perceptually relevant information can be recovered at every level in the hierarchy, that information used in making decisions at one level is not passed on to the next level, and, with one rather special exception (area MT), through all stages of analysis all dimensions of the image remain intimately coupled in a retinotopic map.

    abstract = {{A recent computational theory suggests that visual processing in the retina and the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) serves to recode information into an efficient form (Atick and Redlich, 1990). Information theoretic analysis showed that the representation of visual information at the level of the photoreceptors is inefficient, primarily attributable to a high degree of spatial and temporal correlation in natural scenes. It was predicted, therefore, that the retina and the LGN should recode this signal into a decorrelated form or, equivalently, into a signal with a "white" spatial and temporal power spectrum. In the present study, we tested directly the prediction that visual processing at the level of the LGN temporarily whitens the natural visual input. We recorded the responses of individual neurons in the LGN of the cat to natural, time-varying images (movies) and, as a control, to white-noise stimuli. Although there is substantial temporal correlation in natural inputs (Dong and Atick, 1995b), we found that the power spectra of LGN responses were essentially white. Between 3 and 15 Hz, the power of the responses had an average variation of only +/-10.3\%. Thus, the signals that the LGN relays to visual cortex are temporarily decorrelated. Furthermore, the responses of X-cells to natural inputs can be well predicted from their responses to white-noise inputs. We therefore conclude that whitening of natural inputs can be explained largely by the linear filtering properties (Enroth-Cugell and Robson, 1966). Our results suggest that the early visual pathway is well adapted for efficient coding of information in the natural visual environment, in agreement with the prediction of the computational theory.}},

A significant fact about natural time-varying images is that they do not change randomly over space-time; instead image intensities at different times and/or spatial positions are highly correlated. We measured the spatiotemporal correlation function — equivalently the power spectrum — of natural images and we find that it is non-separable, i.e., coupled in space and time, and exhibits a very interesting scaling behaviour. This behaviour is shown to be related to the motion in the images and the power spectrum is naturally separable into a spatial term and a velocity term. The same kind of spatiotemporal coupling and scaling exists in visual sensitivity measured in physiological and psychophysical experiments. By assuming that the visual system is optimized to process information of natural images, a quantitative relationship can be derived between the power spectrum of natural images and the visual sensitivity. This reveals some interesting aspects of motion vision.}},

    abstract = {{Significant advances in cognitive neuroscience can be achieved by combining techniques used to measure behavior and brain activity with neural modeling. Here we apply this approach to the initiation of rapid eye movements (saccades), which are used to redirect the visual axis to targets of interest. It is well known that the superior colliculus (SC) in the midbrain plays a major role in generating saccadic eye movements, and physiological studies have provided important knowledge of the activity pattern of neurons in this structure. Based on the observation that the SC receives localized sensory (exogenous) and voluntary (endogenous) inputs, our model assumes that this information is integrated by dynamic competition across local collicular interactions. The model accounts well for the effects upon saccadic reaction time (SRT) due to removal of fixation, the presence of distractors, execution of pro- versus antisaccades, and variation in target probability, and suggests a possible mechanism for the generation of express saccades. In each of these cases, the activity patterns of "neurons" within the model closely resemble actual cell behavior in the intermediate layer of the SC. The interaction structure we employ is instrumental for producing a physiologically faithful model and results in new insights and hypotheses regarding the neural mechanisms underlying saccade initiation.}},

                Psychophysical and physiological studies suggest that long-range horizontal connections in primary visual cortex participate in spatial integration and contour processing. Until recently, little attention has been paid to their intrinsic temporal properties. Recent physiological studies indicate, however, that the propagation of activity through long-range horizontal connections is slow, with time scales comparable to the perceptual scales involved in motion processing. Using a simple model of V1 connectivity, we explore some of the implications of this slow dynamics. The model predicts that V1 responses to a stimulus in the receptive field can be modulated by a previous stimulation, a few milliseconds to a few tens of milliseconds before, in the surround. We analyze this phenomenon and its possible consequences on speed perception, as a function of the spatio-temporal configuration of the visual inputs (relative orientation, spatial separation, temporal interval between the elements, sequence speed). We show that the dynamical interactions between feed-forward and horizontal signals in V1 can explain why the perceived speed of fast apparent motion sequences strongly depends on the orientation of their elements relative to the motion axis and can account for the range of speed for which this perceptual effect occurs (Georges, Seri\`{e}s, Fr\'{e}gnac and Lorenceau, this issue).

                The visual cortex has a laminar organization whose circuits form functional columns in cortical maps. How this laminar architecture supports visual percepts is not well understood. A neural model proposes how the laminar circuits of V1 and V2 generate perceptual groupings that maintain sensitivity to the contrasts and spatial organization of scenic cues. The model can decisively choose which groupings cohere and survive, even while balanced excitatory and inhibitory interactions preserve contrast-sensitive measures of local boundary likelihood or strength. In the model, excitatory inputs from lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) activate layers 4 and 6 of V1. Layer 6 activates an on-center off-surround network of inputs to layer 4. Together these layer 4 inputs preserve analog sensitivity to LGN input contrasts. Layer 4 cells excite pyramidal cells in layer 2/3, which activate monosynaptic long-range horizontal excitatory connections between layer 2/3 pyramidal cells, and short-range disynaptic inhibitory connections mediated by smooth stellate cells. These interactions support inward perceptual grouping between two or more boundary inducers, but not outward grouping from a single inducer. These boundary signals feed back to layer 4 via the layer 6-to-4 on-center off-surround network. This folded feedback joins cells in different layers into functional columns while selecting winning groupings. Layer 6 in V1 also sends top-down signals to LGN using an on-center off-surround network, which suppresses LGN cells that do not receive feedback, while selecting, enhancing, and synchronizing activity of those that do. The model is used to simulate psychophysical and neurophysiological data about perceptual grouping, including various Gestalt grouping laws.

                Stimuli presented in a non-attended location are responded to much slower than stimuli presented in an attended one. The hypotheses proposed to explain this effect make reference to covert movement of attention, hemifield inhibition, or attentional gradients. The experiment reported here was aimed at discriminating among these hypotheses. Subjects were cued to attend to one of four possible stimulus locations, which were arranged either horizontally or vertically, above, below, to the right or left of a fixation point. The instructions were to respond manually as fast as possible to the occurrence of a visual stimulus, regardless of whether it occurred in a cued or in a non-cued location. In 70\% of the cued trials the stimulus was presented in the cued location and in 30\% in one of the non-cued locations. In addition there were trials in which a non-directional cue instructed the subject to pay attention to all four locations. The results showed that the correct orienting of attention yielded a small but significant benefit; the incorrect orienting of attention yielded a large and significant cost; the cost tended to increase as a function of the distance between the attended location and the location that was actually stimulated; and an additional cost was incurred when the stimulated and attended locations were on opposite sides of the vertical or horizontal meridian. We concluded that neither the hypothesis postulating hemifield inhibition nor that postulating movement of attention with a constant time can explain the data. The hypothesis of an attention gradient and that of attention movements with a constant speed are tenable in principle, but they fail to account for the effect of crossing the horizontal and vertical meridians. A hypothesis is proposed that postulates a strict link between covert orienting of attention and programming explicit ocular movements. Attention is oriented to a given point when the oculomotor programme for moving the eyes to this point is ready to be executed. Attentional cost is the time required to erase one ocular program and prepare the next one.

The shortest latencies in area V2 were observed in the infragranular layers and they did not differ significantly from those found in the infragranular layers in V1. Similarly, latencies in the supragranular layers of V2 were not significantly different from those measured in the supragranular layers of V1.

                The spatiotemporal patterns of excitatory synaptic activity in response to diffuse lightON and OFF stimuli were examined by means of current source density (CSD) analysis. The qualitative and quantitative analyses obtained from 24 depth profiles for each stimulus revealed obviously different distributions of synaptic activity in the laminar structure. Two or three dominant current sinks I, II, and III were evoked in response to diffuse light ON stimulation. Sink I was observed at the bottom of the retinorecipient layer. Both sinks II and III, showing an identical spatial pattern, were observed just above sink I. On the other hand, diffuse light OFF stimulation elicited up to six current sinks IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, and IX. Sink IV was observed at the bottom of the retinorecipient layer. Sink V was observed in the most superficial layer. Both sinks VI and VIII were located between the two preceding sinks. Finally, sinks VII and IX occurred below the retinorecipient layer. Five electrically evoked current sinks A, B, C, D, and E, characterized in our previous study, were also recognized in the present quantitative analysis. A statistical analysis revealed that, in visually evoked responses, statistical differences in the spatial distribution were not present between sinks I and IV, and sinks II and VIII (P < 0.05). The analysis also showed that, in electrically evoked responses, only a pair of sinks C and E exhibit virtually identical spatial distribution (P < 0.05). Based on well-known properties of the retinal ganglion cells, possible neuronal mechanisms underlying each of current sinks in the ON and OFF channels and their functional meanings were considered. Sink I reflects the excitatory monosynaptic activity derived from R3 retinal ganglion cells. Sink IV reflects the excitatory monosynaptic activity derived from both R3 and R4 cells. Sinks V, VI, VII, and IX may be composed of successive polysynaptic excitatory potentials derived from convergence of inputs from both R3 and R4 cells. We concluded that the early four sinks play in particular an important role in eliciting avoidance behavior. On the other hand, sinks II, III, and VIII reflect excitatory synaptic activities derived from - retinal fibers of another type having slow conduction velocity. These late current sinks were suggested to mediate prey catching and its facilitation.

Here, we seek direct evidence that the SC also contributes to the control of covert spatial attention, a process that focuses attention on a region of space different from the point of gaze. While requiring monkeys to keep their gaze fixed, we tested whether microstimulation of a specific location in the SC spatial map would enhance visual performance at the corresponding region of space, a diagnostic measure of covert attention. We find that microstimulation improves performance in a spatially selective manner: thresholds decrease at the location in visual space represented by the stimulated SC site, but not at a control location in the opposite hemifield. Our data provide direct evidence that the SC contributes to the control of covert spatial attention.}},

    abstract = {{Neuroimaging studies have shown differential amygdala responses to masked ( ” unseen”) emotional stimuli. How visual signals related to such unseen stimuli access the amygdala is unknown. A possible pathway, involving the superior colliculus and pulvinar, is suggested by observations of patients with striate cortex lesions who show preserved abilities to localize and discriminate visual stimuli that are not consciously perceived ( ” blindsight”). We used measures of right amygdala neural activity acquired from volunteer subjects viewing masked fear-conditioned faces to determine whether a colliculo-pulvinar pathway was engaged during processing of these unseen target stimuli. Increased connectivity between right amygdala, pulvinar, and superior colliculus was evident when fear-conditioned faces were unseen rather than seen. Right amygdala connectivity with fusiform and orbitofrontal cortices decreased in the same condition. By contrast, the left amygdala, whose activity did not discriminate seen and unseen fear-conditioned targets, showed no masking-dependent changes in connectivity with superior colliculus or pulvinar. These results suggest that a subcortical pathway to the right amygdala, via midbrain and thalamus, provides a route for processing behaviorally relevant unseen visual events in parallel to a cortical route necessary for conscious identification.}},

    abstract = {{Many studies have established that the strength of visual perception and the strength of visual representations within visual cortex vary according to the focus of covert spatial attention. While it is clear that attention can modulate visual signals, the source of this modulation remains unknown. We have examined the possibility that saccade related mechanisms provide a source of spatial attention by studying the effects of electrical microstimulation of the frontal eye fields (FEF) on spatial attention. Monkeys performed a task in which they had to detect luminance changes of a peripheral target while ignoring a flashing distracter. The target luminance change could be preceded by stimulation of the FEF at current levels below that which evoked saccadic eye movements. We found that when the target change was preceded by stimulation of FEF, the monkey could detect smaller changes in target luminance. The increased sensitivity to the target change only occurred when the target was placed in the part of the visual field represented by neurons at the stimulation site. The magnitude of improvement depended on the temporal asynchrony of the stimulation onset and the target event. No significant effect of stimulation was observed when long intervals (>300 ms) between stimulation and the target event were used, and the magnitude of the increased sensitivity decreased systematically with increasing asynchrony. At the shortest asynchrony, FEF stimulation temporally overlapped the target event and the magnitude of the improvement was comparable to that of removing the distracter from the task. These results demonstrate that transient, but potent improvements in the deployment of covert spatial attention can be obtained by microstimulation of FEF sites from which saccadic eye movements are also evoked.}},

Insofar as this organization represents a general feature of brain architecture, cortical and subcortical inputs to the basal ganglia might act independently, co-operatively or competitively to influence the mechanisms of action selection.}},

Our method is to find what sort of stimulus causes the largest activity in one nerve fiber and then what is the exciting aspect of that stimulus such that variations in everything else cause little change in the response. It has been known for the past 20 years that each fiber is connected not to a few rods and cones in the retina but to very many over a fair area. Our results show that for the most part within that area, it is not the light intensity itself but rather the pattern of local variation of intensity that is the exciting factor. There are four types of fibers, each type concerned with a different sort of pattern. Each type is uniformly distributed over the whole retina of the frog. Thus, there are four distinct parallel distributed channels whereby the frog's eye informs his brain about the visual image in terms of local pattern independent of average illumination. We describe the patterns and show the functional and anatomical separation of the channels. This work has been done on the frog, and our interpretation applies only to the frog.}},

    abstract = {{Primates use two types of voluntary eye movements to track objects of interest: pursuit and saccades. Traditionally, these two eye movements have been viewed as distinct systems that are driven automatically by low-level visual inputs. However, two sets of findings argue for a new perspective on the control of voluntary eye movements. First, recent experiments have shown that pursuit and saccades are not controlled by entirely different neural pathways but are controlled by similar networks of cortical and subcortical regions and, in some cases, by the same neurons. Second, pursuit and saccades are not automatic responses to retinal inputs but are regulated by a process of target selection that involves a basic form of decision making. The selection process itself is guided by a variety of complex processes, including attention, perception, memory, and expectation. Together, these findings indicate that pursuit and saccades share a similar functional architecture. These points of similarity may hold the key for understanding how neural circuits negotiate the links between the many higher order functions that can influence behavior and the singular and coordinated motor actions that follow.}},

Very brief fixations are made on the abrupt onset before the eyes complete their intended movement to the previously defined target. These results indicate concurrent programming of a voluntary saccade to the defined saccade target and an involuntary saccade to the sudden onset. This is inconsistent with the idea that a single salience map determines the location of a saccade in a winner-take-all fashion. Other results indicate that subjects attend to more than one location in a display during saccade preparation, contrary to the claim that covert attentional scanning plays no role in saccade generation.}},

    abstract = {{The basal ganglia and frontal cortex operate together to execute goal directed behaviors. This requires not only the execution of motor plans, but also the behaviors that lead to this execution, including emotions and motivation that drive behaviors, cognition that organizes and plans the general strategy, motor planning, and finally, the execution of that plan. The components of the frontal cortex that mediate these behaviors, are reflected in the organization, physiology, and connections between areas of frontal cortex and in their projections through basal ganglia circuits. This comprises a series of parallel pathways. However, this model does not address how information flows between circuits thereby developing new learned behaviors (or actions) from a combination of inputs from emotional, cognitive, and motor cortical areas. Recent anatomical evidence from primates demonstrates that the neuro-networks within basal ganglia pathways are in a position to move information across functional circuits. Two networks are: the striato-nigral-striatal network and the thalamo-cortical-thalamic network. Within each of these sets of connected structures, there are both reciprocal connections linking up regions associated with similar functions and non-reciprocal connections linking up regions that are associated with different cortical basal ganglia circuits. Each component of information (from limbic to motor outcome) sends both feedback connection, and also a feedforward connection, allowing the transfer of information. Information is channeled from limbic, to cognitive, to motor circuits. Action decision-making processes are thus influenced by motivation and cognitive inputs, allowing the animal to respond appropriate to environmental cues.}},

The wealth of data gathered allowed the conception of numerous computational models. These models proposed descriptions of the putative mechanisms generating this data, and, in turn, made predictions and helped to plan new experiments. In this article, we review the computational models of the five main brain regions involved in saccade generation: reticular formation saccadic burst generators, superior colliculus, cerebellum, basal ganglia and premotor cortical areas. We present the various topics these models are concerned with: location of the feedback loop, multimodal saccades, long-term adaptation, on the fly trajectory correction, strategy and metrics selection, short-term spatial memory, transformations between retinocentric and craniocentric reference frames, sequence learning, to name the principle ones. Our objective is to provide a global view of the whole system. Indeed, narrowing too much the modelled areas while trying to explain too much data is a recurrent problem that should be avoided. Moreover, beyond the multiple research topics remaining to be solved locally, questions regarding the operation of the whole structure can now be addressed by building on the existing models.}},

head on a body supported by the ground, the brain being only the central organ
of a complete visual system. When no constraints are put on the visual system,
people look around, walk up to something interesting and move around it so as

This target article presents an information processing model for the control of these movements, with some close parallels to established physiological processes in the oculomotor system. Two separate pathways are concerned with the spatial and the temporal programming of the movement. In the temporal pathway there is spatially distributed coding and the saccade target is selected from a "salience map." Both pathways descend through a hierarchy of levels, the lower ones operating automatically. Visual onsets have automatic access to the eye control system via the lower levels. Various centres in each pathway are interconnected via reciprocal inhibition. The model accounts for a number of well-established phenomena in target-elicited saccades: the gap effect, express saccades, the remote distractor effect, and the global effect. High-level control of the pathways in tasks such as visual search and reading is discussed; it operates through spatial selection and search selection, which generally combine in an automated way. The model is examined in relation to data from patients with unilateral neglect.}},

The second class contains defensive movements such as avoidance or flight, together with cardiovascular changes, that would be appropriate for a sudden emergency such as the appearance of a predator, or of an object on collision course. The two response systems appear to depend on separate output projections, and are probably subject to different sensory and forebrain influences. These findings (1) suggest an explanation for the complex anatomical organization of the SC, with multiple output pathways differentially accessed by a very wide variety of inputs, (2) emphasize the similarities between the SC and the optic tectum in non-mammalian species, and (3) suggest that the SC may be useful as a model for studying both the sensory control of defensive responses, and how intelligent decisions can be taken about relatively simple sensory inputs.}},

    abstract = {{How does the brain learn to balance between reactive and planned behaviors? The basal ganglia (BG) and frontal cortex together allow animals to learn planned behaviors that acquire rewards when prepotent reactive behaviors are insufficient. This paper proposes a new model, called TELOS, to explain how laminar circuitry of the frontal cortex, exemplified by the frontal eye fields, interacts with the BG, thalamus, superior colliculus, and inferotemporal and parietal cortices to learn and perform reactive and planned eye movements. The model is formulated as fourteen computational hypotheses. These specify how strategy priming and action planning (in cortical layers III, Va and VI) are dissociated from movement execution (in layer Vb), how the BG help to choose among and gate competing plans, and how a visual stimulus may serve either as a movement target or as a discriminative cue to move elsewhere. The direct, indirect and hyperdirect pathways through the BG are shown to enable complex gating functions, including deferred execution of selected plans, and switching among alternative sensory-motor mappings. Notably, the model can learn and gate the use of a What-to-Where transformation that enables spatially invariant object representations to selectively excite spatially coded movement plans. Model simulations show how dopaminergic reward and non-reward signals guide monkeys to learn and perform saccadic eye movements in the fixation, single saccade, overlap, gap, and delay (memory-guided) saccade tasks. Model cell activation dynamics quantitatively simulate seventeen established types of dynamics exhibited by corresponding real cells during performance of these tasks.}},

                The receptive field of a visual neuron is classically defined as the region of space (or retina) where a visual stimulus evokes a change in its firing activity. At the cortical level, a challenging issue concerns the roles of feedforward, local recurrent, intracortical, and cortico-cortical feedback connectivity in receptive field properties. Intracellular recordings in cat area 17 showed that the visually evoked synaptic integration field extends over a much larger area than that established on the basis of spike activity. Synaptic depolarizing responses to stimuli flashed at increasing distances from the center of the receptive field decreased in strength, whereas their onset latency increased. These findings suggest that subthreshold responses in the unresponsive region surrounding the classical discharge field result from the integration of visual activation waves spread by slowly conducting horizontal axons within primary visual cortex.

    abstract = {{To describe phenomena that occur at different time scales, computational models of the brain must incorporate different levels of abstraction. At time scales of approximately 1/3 of a second, orienting movements of the body play a crucial role in cognition and form a useful computational level--more abstract than that used to capture natural phenomena but less abstract than what is traditionally used to study high-level cognitive processes such as reasoning. At this "embodiment level," the constraints of the physical system determine the nature of cognitive operations. The key synergy is that at time scales of about 1/3 of a second, the natural sequentiality of body movements can be matched to the natural computational economies of sequential decision systems through a system of implicit reference called deictic in which pointing movements are used to bind objects in the world to cognitive programs. This target article focuses on how deictic binding make it possible to perform natural tasks. Deictic computation provides a mechanism for representing the essential features that link external sensory data with internal cognitive programs and motor actions. One of the central features of cognition, working memory, can be related to moment-by-moment dispositions of body features such as eye movements and hand movements.}},

@article{citeulike:882586,
    abstract = {{
                Several alternative methods for decoding the desired motor command vector from neural networks containing distributed, place-coded information have been suggested. The two most widely discussed candidate mechanisms are vector summation (VS) and a center-of-mass (CM) computation. The latter mechanism has also been called vector averaging. The present paper compares the operation of these two methods in a model of an experimentally well-studied neural structure, the superior colliculus (SC). The SC is one structure that has been shown to be responsible for generating saccadic command vectors in the form of distributed neural activity that is topologically arranged across its surface. It has been suggested that the pattern of eye-movement errors obtained following the placement of a collicular lesion can distinguish between these two mechanisms. As a result of this suggestion, the pattern of saccadic errors produced by lesions in the SC have been widely cited to support the CM hypothesis. In the present paper the placement of a discrete lesion is simulated in a recurrent (dynamic) neural network model of the SC. These dynamic connections in the model SC network produce a systematic shift of the locus of distributed activity away from the site of the lesion. The spatiotemporal shift in the location of SC activity then produces a pattern of saccadic errors that appear to support the CM hypothesis, even though ensemble activity in our model colliculus is decoded by VS. This result demonstrates that, when ensemble activity on the SC motor map is dynamically modulated over space and time by intrinsic collicular circuitry, an explicit CM computation is not needed to reproduce the pattern of physiological results that follow focal SC lesions.

These correlations persist even after retinal processing and hence, under natural activation conditions, the signal sent to the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) is temporally redundant or inefficient. We explore the hypothesis that the LGN is concerned, among other things, with improving efficiency of visual representation through active temporal decorrelation of the retinal signal much in the same way that the retina improves efficiency by spatially decorrelating incoming images. Using some recently measured statistical properties of time-varying images, we predict the spatio-temporal receptive fields that achieve this decorrelation. It is shown that, because of neuronal nonlinearities, temporal decorrelation requires two response types, the lagged and nonlagged , just as spatial decorrelation requires on and off response types. The tuning and response properties of the predicted LGN cells compare quantitatively well with what is observed in recent physiological experiments.}},

    abstract = {The amount of information a sensory neuron carries about a stimulus is directly related to response reliability. We recorded from individual neurons in the cat lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) while presenting randomly modulated visual stimuli. The responses to repeated stimuli were reproducible, whereas the responses evoked by nonrepeated stimuli drawn from the same ensemble were variable. Stimulus-dependent information was quantified directly from the difference in entropy of these neural responses. We show that a single LGN cell can encode much more visual information than had been demonstrated previously, ranging from 15 to 102 bits/sec across our sample of cells. Information rate was correlated with the firing rate of the cell, for a consistent rate of 3.6 {+/-} 0.6 bits/spike (mean {+/-} SD). This information can primarily be attributed to the high temporal precision with which firing probability is modulated; many individual spikes were timed with better than 1 msec precision. We introduce a way to estimate the amount of information encoded in temporal patterns of firing, as distinct from the information in the time varying firing rate at any temporal resolution. Using this method, we find that temporal patterns sometimes introduce redundancy but often encode visual information. The contribution of temporal patterns ranged from [-]3.4 to +25.5 bits/sec or from [-]9.4 to +24.9\% of the total information content of the responses.},

The middle pair relays input from short-wavelength cones to the cytochrome-oxidase blobs of primay visual cortex (V1), the dorsal-most pair relays low-acuity visual information to layer I of V1, and the ventral-most pair appears closely tied to the function of the superior colliculus. Throughout each K layer are neurons that innervate extrastriate cortex and that are likely to sustain some visual behaviors in the absence of V1.

                To provide information about dynamic sensory stimuli, the pattern of action potentials in spiking neurons must be variable. To ensure reliability these variations must be related, reproducibly, to the stimulus. For H1, a motion-sensitive neuron in the fly's visual system, constant-velocity motion produces irregular spike firing patterns, and spike counts typically have a variance comparable to the mean, for cells in the mammalian cortex. But more natural, time-dependent input signals yield patterns of spikes that are much more reproducible, both in terms of timing and of counting precision. Variability and reproducibility are quantified with ideas from information theory, and measured spike sequences in H1 carry more than twice the amount of information they would if they followed the variance-mean relation seen with constant inputs. Thus, models that may accurately account for the neural response to static stimuli can significantly underestimate the reliability of signal transfer under more natural conditions.

The transition dynamics is equivalent to that of a finite state automaton. A connection rule for the networks guarantees that any finite state automaton can be mapped into the transition dynamics, demonstrating the equivalence in computational power between the networks and finite state automata.

Here we show that stable periodic spike sequences with precise timings are the attractors of the spiking dynamics of recurrent neural networks with global inhibition. Almost all spike sequences converge within a finite number of transient spikes to these attractors. The convergence is fast, especially when the global inhibition is strong. These results support the possibility that precise spatiotemporal sequences of spikes are useful for information encoding and processing in biological neural networks.}},

    abstract = {{The degu (Octodon degus) is a diurnal rodent, native to Chile. Basic features of vision and visual organization in this species were examined in a series of anatomical, electrophysiological and behavioral experiments. The lens of the degu eye selectively absorbs short-wavelength light and shows a progressive increase in optical density as a function of age. Electroretinograms recorded using a flicker-photometric procedure reveal three spectral mechanisms: a rod with peak sensitivity of about 500 nm and two types of cone having respective spectral peaks of about 362 nm and 507 nm. Opsin antibody labeling was used to determine the retinal distributions of the three receptor types. A total of about one-third of the approximately 9 million photoreceptors of the degu retina are cones with the two types (507 nm/362 nm) represented in a ratio of about 13:1. The contributions to vision of all three receptor types were examined in a series of behavioral experiments. A consistent feature of both the electrophysiological and behavioral results is that relatively high levels of light adaptation are required to effect the full transition from rod-based to cone-based vision. In behavioral tests degus were shown to be able to make color discriminations between ultraviolet and visible lights.}},

Recent studies have shown that, although the number of possible activity patterns and underlying interactions is exponentially large, pairwise-based models give a surprisingly accurate description of neural population activity patterns. We explored the architecture of maximum entropy models of the functional interaction networks underlying the response of large populations of retinal ganglion cells, in adult tiger salamander retina, responding to natural and artificial stimuli. We found that we can further simplify these pairwise models by neglecting weak interaction terms or by relying on a small set of interaction strengths. Comparing network interactions under different visual stimuli, we show the existence of local network motifs in the interaction map of the retina. Our results demonstrate that the underlying interaction map of the retina is sparse and dominated by local overlapping interaction modules.}},

                Correlated trial-to-trial variability in the activity of cortical neurons is thought to reflect the functional connectivity of the circuit. Many cortical areas are organized into functional columns, in which neurons are believed to be densely connected and to share common input. Numerous studies report a high degree of correlated variability between nearby cells. We developed chronically implanted multitetrode arrays offering unprecedented recording quality to reexamine this question in the primary visual cortex of awake macaques. We found that even nearby neurons with similar orientation tuning show virtually no correlated variability. Our findings suggest a refinement of current models of cortical microcircuit architecture and function: Either adjacent neurons share only a few percent of their inputs or, alternatively, their activity is actively decorrelated.

    abstract = {{In sensory systems, neurons are generally characterized by their receptive field, namely the sensitivity to activity patterns at the input of the circuit. To assess the role of the neuron in the system, one must also know its projective field, namely the spatiotemporal effects the neuron exerts on all of the outputs of the circuit. We studied both the receptive and projective fields of an amacrine interneuron in the salamander retina. This amacrine type has a sustained OFF response with a small receptive field, but its output projects over a much larger region. Unlike other amacrine cells, this type is remarkably promiscuous and affects nearly every ganglion cell within reach of its dendrites. Its activity modulates the sensitivity of visual responses in ganglion cells but leaves their kinetics unchanged. The projective field displays a center-surround structure: depolarizing a single amacrine suppresses the visual sensitivity of ganglion cells nearby and enhances it at greater distances. This change in sign is seen even within the receptive field of one ganglion cell; thus, the modulation occurs presynaptically on bipolar cell terminals, most likely via GABAB receptors. Such an antagonistic projective field could contribute to the mechanisms of the retina for predictive coding.}},

    abstract = {{We present a new method for autonomous real-time spike sorting using a fuzzy logic inference engine. The engine assigns each detected event a 'spikiness index' from zero to one that quantifies the extent to which the detected event is like an ideal spike. Spikes can then be sorted by simply clustering the spikiness indices. The sorter is defined in terms of natural language rules that, once defined, are static and thus require no user intervention or calibration. The sorter was tested using extracellular recordings from three animals: a macaque, an owl monkey and a rat. Simulation results show that the fuzzy sorter performed equal to or better than the benchmark principal component analysis (PCA) based sorter. Importantly, there was no degradation in fuzzy sorter performance when the spikes were not temporally aligned prior to sorting. In contrast, PCA sorter performance dropped by 27\% when sorting unaligned spikes. Since the fuzzy sorter is computationally trivial and requires no spike alignment, it is suitable for scaling into large numbers of parallel channels where computational overhead and the need for operator intervention would preclude other spike sorters.}},

We intracellularly labeled ganglion cells in different transgenic mouse lines, allowing a morphological classification of bistratified ganglion cells, an analysis of their coupling pattern, and the molecular identification of the connexins responsible for the coupling. Based on dendritic characteristics including co-fasciculation with the dendrites of cholinergic starburst amacrine cells, we were able to distinguish three types of bistratified ganglion cells. Two of these co-fasciculate with starburst amacrine cells and exhibit a specific homologous coupling pattern. Connexin45 (Cx45) appears to be the major component of the gap junctional channels because tracer coupling is absent in Cx45-deficient animals whereas it persists in Cx36-deficient animals. It is speculated that the transjunctional voltage dependence of Cx45 channels could support the transmission of direction selectivity.}},

The circuit's essential building block is a rapid inhibitory pathway: it selectively suppresses responses to non-approaching objects. This rapid inhibitory pathway, which includes AII amacrine cells connected to bipolar cells through electrical synapses, was previously described in the context of night-time vision. In the daytime conditions of our experiments, the same pathway conveys signals in the reverse direction.

                The primate visual system consists of parallel pathways initiated by distinct cell types in the retina that encode different features of the visual scene. Small bistratified cells (SBCs), which form a major projection to the thalamus, exhibit blue-ON/yellow-OFF [S-ON/(L+M)-OFF] light responses thought to be important for high-acuity color vision. However, the spatial processing properties of individual SBCs and their spatial arrangement across the visual field are poorly understood. The present study of peripheral primate retina reveals that contrary to previous suggestions, SBCs exhibit center-surround spatial structure, with the (L+M)-OFF component of the receptive field approximately 50\% larger in diameter than the S-ON component. Analysis of response kinetics shows that the (L+M)-OFF response in SBCs is slower than the S-ON response and significantly less transient than that of simultaneously recorded OFF-parasol cells. The (L+M)-OFF response in SBCs was eliminated by bath application of the metabotropic glutamate receptor agonist L-APB. These observations indicate that the (L+M)-OFF response of SBCs is not formed by OFF-bipolar cell input as has been suspected and suggest that it arises from horizontal cell feedback. Finally, the receptive fields of SBCs form orderly mosaics, with overlap and regularity similar to those of ON-parasol cells. Thus, despite their distinctive morphology and chromatic properties, SBCs exhibit two features of other retinal ganglion cell types: center-surround antagonism and regular mosaic sampling of visual space.

Multi-electrode technology was used to record simultaneously from complete populations of the retinal ganglion cell types (midget, parasol and small bistratified) that transmit high-resolution visual signals to the brain. Fine-grained visual stimulation was used to identify the location, type and strength of the functional input of each cone photoreceptor to each ganglion cell. The populations of ON and OFF midget and parasol cells each sampled the complete population of long- and middle-wavelength-sensitive cones. However, only OFF midget cells frequently received strong input from short-wavelength-sensitive cones. ON and OFF midget cells showed a small non-random tendency to selectively sample from either long- or middle-wavelength-sensitive cones to a degree not explained by clumping in the cone mosaic.

We recorded from nearby clusters of ganglion cells, testing their ability to determine the location of small flashed spots, and we compared the results to the prediction of a Gaussian receptive field model derived from reverse correlation. Despite considerable receptive field overlap, almost all ganglion cell pairs signaled nearly independently. For groups of five cells with highly overlapping receptive fields, the measured light-evoked currents encoded ∼33\% more information than predicted by the Gaussian receptive field model. Including measured local irregularities in the receptive field model increased performance to the level observed experimentally. These results suggest that instead of being an unavoidable defect, irregularities may be a positive design feature of population neural codes.}},

                Event-driven simulation strategies were proposed recently to simulate integrate-and-fire (IF) type neuronal models. These strategies can lead to computationally efficient algorithms for simulating large-scale networks of neurons; most important, such approaches are more precise than traditional clock-driven numerical integration approaches because the timing of spikes is treated exactly. The drawback of such event-driven methods is that in order to be efficient, the membrane equations must be solvable analytically, or at least provide simple analytic approximations for the state variables describing the system. This requirement prevents, in general, the use of conductance-based synaptic interactions within the framework of event-driven simulations and, thus, the investigation of network paradigms where synaptic conductances are important. We propose here a number of extensions of the classical leaky IF neuron model involving approximations of the membrane equation with conductance-based synaptic current, which lead to simple analytic expressions for the membrane state, and therefore can be used in the event-driven framework. These conductance-based IF (gIF) models are compared to commonly used models, such as the leaky IF model or biophysical models in which conductances are explicitly integrated. All models are compared with respect to various spiking response properties in the presence of synaptic activity, such as the spontaneous discharge statistics, the temporal precision in resolving synaptic inputs, and gain modulation under in vivo-like synaptic bombardment. Being based on the passive membrane equation with fixed-threshold spike generation, the proposed gIF models are situated in between leaky IF and biophysical models but are much closer to the latter with respect to their dynamic behavior and response characteristics, while still being nearly as computationally efficient as simple IF neuron models. gIF models should therefore provide a useful tool for efficient and precise simulation of large-scale neuronal networks with realistic, conductance-based synaptic interactions.

    abstract = {{Cone photoreceptors and horizontal cells (HCs) have a reciprocal synapse that underlies lateral inhibition and establishes the antagonistic center-surround organization of the visual system. Cones transmit to HCs through an excitatory synapse and HCs feed back to cones through an inhibitory synapse. Here we report that HCs also transmit to cone terminals a positive feedback signal that elevates intracellular Ca2+ and accelerates neurotransmitter release. Positive and negative feedback are both initiated by AMPA receptors on HCs, but positive feedback appears to be mediated by a change in HC Ca2+, whereas negative feedback is mediated by a change in HC membrane potential. Local uncaging of AMPA receptor agonists suggests that positive feedback is spatially constrained to active HC-cone synapses, whereas the negative feedback signal spreads through HCs to affect release from surrounding cones. By locally offsetting the effects of negative feedback, positive feedback may amplify photoreceptor synaptic release without sacrificing HC-mediated contrast enhancement. Visual images are projected by the lens of the eye onto a sheet of photoreceptor cells in the retina called rods and cones. Like the pixels in a digital camera, each photoreceptor generates an electrical response proportional to the local light intensity. Each photoreceptor then initiates a chemical signal that is transmitted to downstream neurons, ultimately reaching the brain. But unlike the pixels of a digital camera, photoreceptors indirectly inhibit one another through laterally projecting horizontal cells. Horizontal cells integrate signals from many photoreceptors and provide inhibitory feedback. This feedback is thought to underlie  ” lateral inhibition,” a process that sharpens our perception of contrast and color. Here we report the surprising finding that horizontal cells also provide positive feedback to photoreceptors, utilizing a mechanism distinct from negative feedback. The positive feedback signal is constrained to individual horizontal cell–photoreceptor connections, whereas the negative feedback signal spreads throughout a horizontal cell to affect many surrounding photoreceptors. By locally offsetting negative feedback, positive feedback boosts the photoreceptor signal while preserving contrast enhancement.}},

    abstract = {{In primates, one type of retinal ganglion cell, the parasol cell, makes gap junctions with amacrine cells, the inhibitory, local circuit neurons. To study the effects of these gap junctions, we developed a linear, mathematical model of the retinal circuitry providing input to parasol cells. Electrophysiological studies have indicated that gap junctions do not enlarge the receptive field centres of parasol cells, but our results suggest that they make other contributions to their light responses. According to our model, the coupled amacrine cells enhance the responses of parasol cells to luminance contrast by disinhibition. We also show how a mixed chemical and electrical synapse between two sets of amacrine cells presynaptic to the parasol cells might make the responses of parasol cells more transient and, therefore, more sensitive to motion. Finally, we show how coupling via amacrine cells can synchronize the firing of parasol cells. An action potential in a model parasol cell can excite neighbouring parasol cells, but only when the coupled amacrine cells also fire action potentials. Passive conduction was ineffective due to low-pass temporal filtering. Inhibition from the axons of the coupled amacrine cells also produced oscillations that might synchronize the firing of more distant ganglion cells.}},

In the cat primary visual cortex we compare responses to natural inputs with those to noise inputs matched for luminance and contrast. We find that neural filters adaptively change with the input ensemble so as to increase the information carried by the neural response about the filtered stimulus. Adaptation affects the spatial frequency composition of the filter, enhancing sensitivity to under-represented frequencies in agreement with optimal encoding arguments. Adaptation occurs over 40 s to many minutes, longer than most previously reported forms of adaptation.}},

We have in mind a model in which neurons are selective for a small number of stimulus dimensions out of a high-dimensional stimulus space, but within this subspace the responses can be arbitrarily nonlinear. Existing analysis methods are based on correlation functions between stimuli and responses, but these methods are guaranteed to work only in the case of gaussian stimulus ensembles. As an alternative to correlation functions, we maximize the mutual information between the neural responses and projections of the stimulus onto low-dimensional subspaces. The procedure can be done iteratively by increasing the dimensionality of this subspace. Those dimensions that allow the recovery of all of the information between spikes and the full unprojected stimuli describe the relevant subspace. If the dimensionality of the relevant subspace indeed is small, it becomes feasible to map the neuron's input-output function even under fully natural stimulus conditions.

    abstract = {{We introduce a novel class of white-noise analyses, named local spectral reverse correlation (LSRC), which is capable of revealing various aspects of visual receptive field profiles that were undetectable previously in a single simple measurement. The method is based on spectral analyses in a two-dimensional spatial frequency domain for spatially localized areas within and around their receptive fields. Extracellular single-unit recordings were performed for area 17 and 18 neurons in anesthetized cats. A dynamic dense noise pattern was presented in which the pattern covered an area two to three times larger than the classical receptive field. Spike trains were then cross-correlated with frequency spectra of localized noise pattern to obtain spatially localized selectivity maps in the two-dimensional frequency domain. Our findings are as follows. (1) The new LSRC method allows measurements of two-dimensional frequency tunings and their spatial extent even for cells with substantial nonlinearity. (2) A small subset of neurons shows spatial inhomogeneity in the two-dimensional frequency tunings. (3) In addition to facilitatory response profiles, we can also visualize suppressive profiles localized both in space and spatial frequency domains. Our results suggest that the new analysis technique can be a powerful tool for measuring visual response profiles that contain inhomogeneity in space, as well as for studying neurons with substantial nonlinearities. These features make the method particularly suitable for studying response profiles of neurons in early as well as intermediate extrastriate visual areas.}},

    abstract = {{Traditional approaches to characterizing the transformation from stimulus to response in sensory systems assume both stationarity of the stimulus and time-invariance of the stimulus/response mapping. However, recent studies of sensory function under natural stimulus conditions have demonstrated important features of neural encoding that are in violation of these assumptions. Many sensory neurons respond to changes in the statistical distribution of the stimulus that are characteristic of the natural environment with corresponding changes in their encoding properties. In this paper, an extended recursive least-squares (ERLS) approach to adaptive estimation from stimulus/response observations is detailed. The ERLS approach improves the tracking ability of standard RLS approaches to adaptive estimation by removing a number of assumptions about the underlying system and the stimulus environment. The ERLS framework also incorporates an adaptive learning rate, so that prior knowledge of the relationship between the stimulus and the adaptive nature of the system under investigation can be used to improve tracking performance. Simulated and experimental neural responses are used to demonstrate the ability of the ERLS approach to track adaptation of encoding properties during a single stimulus/response trial. The ERLS framework lends tremendous flexibility to experimental design, facilitating the investigation of sensory function under naturalistic stimulus conditions.}},

@article{citeulike:9230826,
    abstract = {{The functional separation of ON and OFF pathways, one of the fundamental features of the visual system, starts in the retina. During postnatal development, some retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) whose dendrites arborize in both ON and OFF sublaminae of the inner plexiform layer transform into RGCs with dendrites that monostratify in either the ON or OFF sublamina, acquiring final dendritic morphology in a subtype-dependent manner. Little is known about how the receptive field (RF) properties of ON, OFF, and ON-OFF RGCs mature during this time because of the lack of a reliable and efficient method to classify RGCs into these subtypes. To address this deficiency, we developed an innovative variant of Spike Triggered Covariance (STC) analysis, which we term Spike Triggered Covariance - Non-Centered (STC-NC) analysis. Using a multi-electrode array (MEA), we recorded the responses of a large population of mouse RGCs to a Gaussian white noise stimulus. As expected, the Spike-Triggered Average (STA) fails to identify responses driven by symmetric static nonlinearities such as those that underlie ON-OFF center RGC behavior. The STC-NC technique, in contrast, provides an efficient means to identify ON-OFF responses and quantify their RF center sizes accurately. Using this new tool, we find that RGCs gradually develop sensitivity to focal stimulation after eye opening, that the percentage of ON-OFF center cells decreases with age, and that RF centers of ON and ON-OFF cells become smaller. Importantly, we demonstrate for the first time that neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) regulates the development of physiological properties of ON-OFF center RGCs. Overexpression of NT-3 leads to the precocious maturation of RGC responsiveness and accelerates the developmental decrease of RF center size in ON-OFF cells. In summary, our study introduces STC-NC analysis which successfully identifies subtype RGCs and demonstrates how RF development relates to a neurotrophic driver in the retina.}},

    abstract = {{The spikes generated by a neuron in response to stimuli provide information about the nature of the stimuli and also about the functional organization of the circuit in which the neuron is embedded. Spike-triggered analysis techniques such as spike-triggered covariance (STC) have been proposed to characterize the receptive field properties of neurons. So far, they have been able to provide only limited information about the functional organization of neural circuitry; in particular, STC tends to generate subfields that are mixed observations of independent processes. We address this problem by adding a criterion that sources are independent, resulting in an approach we call spike-triggered independent component analysis (ST-ICA). The method exploits the central limit theorem to find the directions in the high-dimensional stimulus space of spike-triggered data that are most independent. We demonstrate the improvement of the ST-ICA method over STC analysis using simulated neurons. When tested on data obtained from the H1 neuron in the fly visual system, it predicts a spatial arrangement of functional subunits with adjacent receptive fields. The properties of these subunits strongly resemble the known properties of elementary movement detector inputs to the H1 neuron. Using the ST-ICA method, we derive a model that captures functional and physiological properties of fly motion vision.}},

Previously, we have shown that these receptive field properties may be accounted for in terms of a strategy for producing a sparse distribution of output activity in response to natural images (Olshausen and Field, 1996a). Here, in addition to describing this work in a more expansive fashion, we examine the neurobiological implications of sparse coding. Of particular interest is the case when the code is overcomplete---i.e., when the number of code elements is greater than the effective dimensionality of the input space. Because the basis functions are non-orthogonal and not linearly independent of each other, sparsifying the code will recruit only those basis functions necessary for representing a given input, and so the input-output fun...}},

Any non-academic use requires the permission of the authors. We present a non-linear kernel-based version of the Recursive Least Squares (RLS) algorithm. Our Kernel-RLS (KRLS) algorithm performs linear regression in the feature space induced by a Mercer kernel, and can therefore be used to recursively construct the minimum meansquared-error regressor. Sparsity of the solution is achieved by a sequential sparsification process that admits into the kernel representation a new input sample only if its feature space image cannot be sufficiently well approximated by combining the images of previously admitted samples. This sparsification procedure is crucial to the operation of KRLS, as it allows it to operate on-line, and by effectively regularizing its solutions. A theoretical analysis of the sparsification method reveals its close affinity to kernel PCA, and a data-dependent loss bound is presented, quantifying the generalization performance of the KRLS algorithm. We demonstrate the performance and scaling properties of KRLS and compare it to a stateof-the-art Support Vector Regression algorithm, using both synthetic and real data. We additionally test KRLS on two signal processing problems in which the use of traditional least-squares methods is commonplace: Time series prediction and channel equalization.}},

                Several theoretical, computational, and experimental studies suggest that neurons encode sensory information using a small number of active neurons at any given point in time. This strategy, referred to as 'sparse coding', could possibly confer several advantages. First, it allows for increased storage capacity in associative memories; second, it makes the structure in natural signals explicit; third, it represents complex data in a way that is easier to read out at subsequent levels of processing; and fourth, it saves energy. Recent physiological recordings from sensory neurons have indicated that sparse coding could be a ubiquitous strategy employed in several different modalities across different organisms.

                The receptive fields of simple cells in mammalian primary visual cortex can be characterized as being spatially localized, oriented and bandpass (selective to structure at different spatial scales), comparable to the basis functions of wavelet transforms. One approach to understanding such response properties of visual neurons has been to consider their relationship to the statistical structure of natural images in terms of efficient coding. Along these lines, a number of studies have attempted to train unsupervised learning algorithms on natural images in the hope of developing receptive fields with similar properties, but none has succeeded in producing a full set that spans the image space and contains all three of the above properties. Here we investigate the proposal that a coding strategy that maximizes sparseness is sufficient to account for these properties. We show that a learning algorithm that attempts to find sparse linear codes for natural scenes will develop a complete family of localized, oriented, bandpass receptive fields, similar to those found in the primary visual cortex. The resulting sparse image code provides a more efficient representation for later stages of processing because it possesses a higher degree of statistical independence among its outputs.

Here, "independence" should be understood in its strong statistical sense: it goes beyond (second-order) decorrelation and thus involves the non-Gaussianity of the data.The ideal measure of independence is the "mutual information" and is known to be related to the entropy of the components when the search for components is restricted to uncorrelated components.This paper explores the connections between mutual information, entropy and non-Gaussianity in a larger framework, without resorting to a somewhat arbitrary decorrelation constraint. A key result is that the mutual information can be decomposed, under linear transforms, as the sum of two terms: one term expressing the decorrelation of the components and one expressing their non-Gaussianity.Our results extend the previous understanding of these connections and explain them in the light of information geometry. We also describe the "local geometry" of ICA by re-expressing all our results via a Gram-Charlier expansion by which all quantities of interest are obtained in terms of cumulants.}},

Moreover, the learning rule is also applicable to the more realistic case of neuron models with refractoriness, and is sensitive to correlations between input spikes, even in the absence of presynaptic rate modulation. The learning rule is found by maximizing the mutual information between presynaptic and postsynaptic spike trains under the constraint that the postsynaptic firing rate stays close to some target firing rate.

    abstract = {{We consider the problem of efficiently encoding a signal by transforming it to a new representation whose components are statistically independent. A widely studied linear solution, known as independent component analysis (ICA), exists for the case when the signal is generated as a linear transformation of independent nongaussian sources. Here, we examine a complementary case, in which the source is nongaussian and elliptically symmetric. In this case, no invertible linear transform suffices to decompose the signal into independent components, but we show that a simple nonlinear transformation, which we call radial gaussianization (RG), is able to remove all dependencies. We then examine this methodology in the context of natural image statistics. We first show that distributions of spatially proximal bandpass filter responses are better described as elliptical than as linearly transformed independent sources. Consistent with this, we demonstrate that the reduction in dependency achieved by applying RG to either nearby pairs or blocks of bandpass filter responses is significantly greater than that achieved by ICA. Finally, we show that the RG transformation may be closely approximated by divisive normalization, which has been used to model the nonlinear response properties of visual neurons.}},

While the linear RFs of early neurons have been well studied, RFs of cortical complex cells are nonlinear and therefore difficult to characterize, especially in the context of natural stimuli. In this study, we used a nonlinear technique to compute the RFs of complex cells from their responses to natural images. We found that each RF is well described by a small number of subunits, which are oriented, localized, and bandpass. These subunits contribute to neuronal responses in a contrast-dependent, polarity-invariant manner, and they can largely predict the orientation and spatial frequency tuning of the cell. Although the RF structures measured with natural images were similar to those measured with random stimuli, natural images were more effective for driving complex cells, thus facilitating rapid identification of the subunits. The subunit RF model provides a useful basis for understanding cortical processing of natural stimuli.}},

    abstract = {{Responses were evoked from ganglion cells in catfish and frog retinas by a Gaussian modulation of the mean luminance. An algorithm was devised to decompose intracellularly recorded responses into the slow and spike components and to extract the time of occurrence of a spike discharge. The dynamics of both signals were analyzed in terms of a series of first-through third-order kernels obtained by cross-correlating the slow (analog) or spike (discrete or point process) signals against the white-noise input. We found that, in the catfish, (a) the slow signals were composed mostly of postsynaptic potentials, (b) their linear components reflected the dynamics found in bipolar cells or in the linear response component of type-N (sustained) amacrine cells, and (c) their nonlinear components were similar to those found in either type-N or type-C (transient) amacrine cells. A comparison of the dynamics of slow and spike signals showed that the characteristic linear and nonlinear dynamics of slow signals were encoded into a spike train, which could be recovered through the cross-correlation between the white-noise input and the spike (point process signals. In addition, well-defined spike correlates could predict the observed slow potentials. In the spike discharges from frog ganglion cells, the linear (or first-order) kernels were all inhibitory, whereas the second-order kernels had characteristics of on-off transient excitation. The transient and sustained amacrine cells similar to those found in catfish retina were the sources of the nonlinear excitation. We conclude that bipolar cells and possibly the linear part of the type-N cell response are the source of linear, either excitatory or inhibitory, components of the ganglion cell responses, whereas amacrine cells are the source of the cells' static nonlinearity.}},

                Probing the visual system with the ensemble of signals that occur in the natural environment may reveal aspects of processing that are not evident in the neural responses to artificial stimulus sets, such as conventional bars and sinusoidal gratings. However, unsolved is the question of how to use complex natural stimulation, many aspects of which the experimenter cannot completely specify, to study neural processing. Here a method is presented to investigate the structure of a neuron's receptive field based on its response to movie clips and other stimulus ensembles. As a particular case, the technique provides an estimate of the conventional first-order receptive field of a neuron, similar to what can be obtained with other reverse-correlation schemes. This is demonstrated experimentally and with computer simulations. Our analysis also revealed that the receptive fields of both simple and complex cells had regions where image boundaries, independent of their contrast sign, would enhance or suppress the cell's response. In some cases, these signals were tuned for the orientation of the boundary. This demonstrates for the first time that it might be feasible to investigate the receptive field structure of visual neurons from their responses to natural image sequences.

But explanations for its design--why it is just so--need to be addressed at the synaptic level, a much finer scale where the basic description is still lacking. Functional architecture of the retina is known from the scale of millimetres down to nanometres, so we have sought explanations for various aspects of its design. Here we review several aspects of the retina's functional architecture and find that all seem governed by a single principle: represent the most information for the least cost in space and energy. Specifically: (i) why are OFF ganglion cells more numerous than ON cells? Because natural scenes contain more negative than positive contrasts, and the retina matches its neural resources to represent them equally well; (ii) why do ganglion cells of a given type overlap their dendrites to achieve 3-fold coverage? Because this maximizes total information represented by the array--balancing signal-to-noise improvement against increased redundancy; (iii) why do ganglion cells form multiple arrays? Because this allows most information to be sent at lower rates, decreasing the space and energy costs for sending a given amount of information. This broad principle, operating at higher levels, probably contributes to the brain's immense computational efficiency.}},

The transformation is implemented by wavelets. The kernel describing the system is then derived by simply dividing the response wavelet by the stimulus wavelet. The results are averaged over time, incorporating median filtering to remove artifacts. Estimated kernels match well to the actual kernels, with little data needed.

    abstract = {{The response of visual cells is a nonlinear function of their stimuli. In addition, an increasing amount of evidence shows that visual cells are optimized to process natural images. Hence, finding good nonlinear models to characterize visual cells using natural stimuli is important. The Volterra model is an appealing nonlinear model for visual cells. However, their large number of parameters and the limited size of physiological recordings have hindered its application. Recently, a substantiated hypothesis stating that the responses of each visual cell could depend on an especially low-dimensional subspace of the image space has been proposed. We use this low-dimensional subspace in the Volterra relevant-space technique to allow the estimation of high-order Volterra models. Most laboratories characterize the response of visual cells as a nonlinear function on the low-dimensional subspace. They estimate this nonlinear function using histograms and by fitting parametric functions to them. Here, we compare the Volterra model with these histogram-based techniques. We use simulated data from cortical simple cells as well as simulated and physiological data from cortical complex cells. Volterra models yield equal or superior predictive power in all conditions studied. Several methods have been proposed to estimate the low-dimensional subspace. In this article, we test projection pursuit regression (PPR), a nonlinear regression algorithm. We compare PPR with two popular models used in vision: spike-triggered average (STA) and spike-triggered covariance (STC). We observe that PPR has advantages over these alternative algorithms. Hence, we conclude that PPR is a viable algorithm to recover the relevant subspace from natural images and that the Volterra model, estimated through the Volterra relevant-space technique, is a compelling alternative to histogram-based techniques.}},

entropy models6–9 to characterize multiple-tetrode recordings
from primary visual cortex of anaesthetized macaque monkeys

among local clusters of neurons (,300 mm apart) with those of
neurons separated by larger distances (600–2,500 mm). Here we
report that local firing patterns are distinctive: whereas multineuronal
firing patterns at larger distances can be predicted by
pairwise interactions, patterns within local clusters often show
evidence of high-order correlations. Surprisingly, these local correlations
are flexible and rapidly reorganized by visual input.
Although they modestly reduce the amount of information that
a cluster conveys, they also modify the format of this information,
creating sparser codes by increasing the periods of total quiescence,
and concentrating information into briefer periods of
common activity. These results imply a hierarchical organization
of neuronal correlations: simple pairwise correlations link neurons

    abstract = {{In this thesis, I describe a quantitative model that accounts for the circuits and computationsof the feedforward path of the ventral stream of visual cortex. This model is consistentwith a general theory of visual processing that extends the hierarchical model of[Hubel and Wiesel, 1959] from primary to extrastriate visual areas. It attempts to explainthe first fewhundredmilliseconds of visual processing and  ” immediate recognition”.One of the key elements in the approach is the learning of a generic dictionary of shapecomponentsfrom V2 to IT, which provides an invariant representation to task-specific categorizationcircuits in higher brain areas. This vocabulary of shape-tuned units is learnedin an unsupervised manner from natural images, and constitutes a large and redundantset of image features with different complexities and invariances. This theory significantlyextends an earlier approach by [Riesenhuber and Poggio, 1999a] and builds upon severalexisting neurobiological models and conceptual proposals.First, I present evidence to show that the model can duplicate the tuning properties ofneurons in various brain areas (e.g., V1, V4 and IT). In particular, the model agrees withdata from V4 about the response of neurons to combinations of simple two-bar stimuli[Reynolds et al., 1999] (within the receptive field of the S2 units) and some of the C2 unitsin the model show a tuning for boundary conformations which is consistent with recordingsfrom V4 [Pasupathy and Connor, 2001]. Second, I show that not only can the modelduplicate the tuning properties of neurons in various brain areas when probed with artificialstimuli, but it can also handle the recognition of objects in the real-world, to theextent of competing with the best computer vision systems. Third, I describe a comparisonbetween the performance of the model and the performance of human observers ina rapid animal vs. non-animal recognition task for which recognition is fast and corticalback-projections are likely to be inactive. Results indicate that the model predicts humanperformance extremely well when the delay between the stimulus and the mask is about50 ms. This suggests that cortical back-projections may not play a significant role whenthe time interval is in this range, and the model may therefore provide a satisfactory descriptionof the feedforward path.Taken together, the evidences suggest that we may have the skeleton of a successfultheory of visual cortex. In addition, this may be the first time that a neurobiological model,faithful to the physiology and the anatomy of visual cortex, not only competes with someof the best computer vision systems thus providing a realistic alternative to engineeredartificial vision systems, but also achieves performance close to that of humans in a categorizationtask involving complex natural images.Thesis Supervisor: Tomaso Poggio}},

    abstract = {{We measured the effect of global phase manipulations on a rapid animal categorization task. The Fourier spectra of our images of natural scenes were manipulated by adding zero-mean random phase noise at all spatial frequencies. The phase noise was the independent variable, uniformly and symmetrically distributed between 0 degrees and +/-180 degrees . Subjects were remarkably resistant to phase noise. Even with +/-120 degrees phase noise subjects were still performing at 75\% correct. The high resistance of the subjects' animal categorization rate to phase noise suggests that the visual system is highly robust to such random image changes. The proportion of correct answers closely followed the correlation between original and the phase noise-distorted images. Animal detection rate was higher when the same task was performed with contrast reduced versions of the same natural images, at contrasts where the contrast reduction mimicked that resulting from our phase randomization. Since the subjects' categorization rate was better in the contrast experiment, reduction of local contrast alone cannot explain the performance in the phase noise experiment. This result obtained with natural images differs from those obtained for simple sinusoidal stimuli were performance changes due to phase changes are attributed to local contrast changes only. Thus the global phase-change accompanying disruption of image structure such as edges and object boundaries at different spatial scales reduces object classification over and above the performance deficit resulting from reducing contrast. Additional color information improves the categorization performance by 2\%.}},

Natural scenes have many theoretical and practical advantages over traditional, artificial stimuli; however, the receptive-field estimation methods are more complex than for white-noise stimuli. Here, we describe and justify several of these methods-spectral correction of the reverse correlation estimate, direct least-squares solution, iterative least-squares algorithms and regularized least-squares solutions. We investigate the pros and cons of the different methods, and evaluate them in a head-to-head comparison for simulated simple-cell data. This shows that, at least for quasilinear simulated simple cells, a regularized solution ('reginv') is most efficient, requiring fewer stimulus presentations for high-resolution reconstruction of the first-order kernel. We also investigate several practical issues that determine the success of this kind of experiment-the effects of neuronal nonlinearities, response variability and the choice of stimulus regime.}},

important differences in neural responses to natural and artificial stimuli. However, natural stimuli typically contain strong
correlations and are spherically asymmetric (i.e. stimulus intensities are not symmetrically distributed around the mean), and
these statistical complexities can bias receptive field (RF) estimates when standard techniques such as spike-triggered
averaging or reverse correlation are used. While a number of approaches have been developed to explicitly correct the bias
due to stimulus correlations, there is no complementary technique to correct the bias due to stimulus asymmetries. Here,
we develop a method for RF estimation that corrects reverse correlation RF estimates for the spherical asymmetries present
in natural stimuli. Using simulated neural responses, we demonstrate how stimulus asymmetries can bias reverse-correlation
RF estimates (even for uncorrelated stimuli) and illustrate how this bias can be removed by explicit correction. We
demonstrate the utility of the asymmetry correction method under experimental conditions by estimating RFs from the
responses of retinal ganglion cells to natural stimuli and using these RFs to predict responses to novel stimuli.}},

    abstract = {{In the visual system, large ensembles of neurons collectively sample visual space with receptive fields (RFs). A puzzling problem is how neural ensembles provide a uniform, high-resolution visual representation in spite of irregularities in the RFs of individual cells. This problem was approached by simultaneously mapping the RFs of hundreds of primate retinal ganglion cells. As observed in previous studies, RFs exhibited irregular shapes that deviated from standard Gaussian models. Surprisingly, these irregularities were coordinated at a fine spatial scale: RFs interlocked with their neighbors, filling in gaps and avoiding large variations in overlap. RF shapes were coordinated with high spatial precision: the observed uniformity was degraded by angular perturbations as small as 15 degrees, and the observed populations sampled visual space with more than 50\% of the theoretical ideal uniformity. These results show that the primate retina encodes light with an exquisitely coordinated array of RF shapes, illustrating a higher degree of functional precision in the neural circuitry than previously appreciated.}},

Third, information-theoretic data analyses open up novel ways to search for those stimuli that are most efficient in driving a given neuron in terms of its firing rate or coding quality.

Using a simple model for the generation of graded electrical signals by sodium and potassium channels, we find optimum numbers of channels that maximize energy efficiency. The optima depend on several factors: the relative magnitudes of the signaling cost (current flow through channels), the fixed cost of maintaining the system, the reliability of the input, additional sources of noise, and the relative costs of upstream and downstream mechanisms. We also analyze how the statistics of input signals influence energy efficiency. We find that energy-efficient signal ensembles favor a bimodal distribution of channel activations and contain only a very small fraction of large inputs when energy is scarce. We conclude that when energy use is a significant constraint, trade-offs between information transfer and energy can strongly influence the number of signaling molecules and synapses used by neurons and the manner in which these mechanisms represent information.}},

Nevertheless, some concerns have recently been raised with regard to the sufficiency of current embodied AI for advancing our scientific understanding of intentional agency. While from an engineering or computer science perspective this limitation might not be relevant, it is of course highly relevant for AI researchers striving to build accurate models of natural cognition. We argue that the biological foundations of enactive cognitive science can provide the conceptual tools that are needed to diagnose more clearly the shortcomings of current embodied AI. In particular, taking an enactive perspective points to the need for AI to take seriously the organismic roots of autonomous agency and sense-making. We identify two necessary systemic requirements, namely constitutive autonomy and adaptivity, which lead us to introduce two design principles of enactive AI. It is argued that the development of such enactive AI poses a significant challenge to current methodologies. However, it also provides a promising way of eventually overcoming the current limitations of embodied AI, especially in terms of providing fuller models of natural embodied cognition. Finally, some practical implications and examples of the two design principles of enactive AI are also discussed.}},

    abstract = {{Soon after Shannon defined the concept of redundancy it was suggested that it gave insight into mechanisms of sensory processing, perception, intelligence and inference. Can we now judge whether there is anything in this idea, and can we see where it should direct our thinking? This paper argues that the original hypothesis was wrong in over-emphasizing the role of compressive coding and economy in neuron numbers, but right in drawing attention to the importance of redundancy. Furthermore there is a clear direction in which it now points, namely to the overwhelming importance of probabilities and statistics in neuroscience. The brain has to decide upon actions in a competitive, chance-driven world, and to do this well it must know about and exploit the non-random probabilities and interdependences of objects and events signalled by sensory messages. These are particularly relevant for Bayesian calculations of the optimum course of action. Instead of thinking of neural representations as transformations of stimulus energies, we should regard them as approximate estimates of the probable truths of hypotheses about the current environment, for these are the quantities required by a probabilistic brain working on Bayesian principles.}},

Although a variety of measurements indicate the existence of such dependencies1, 2, 3, their origin and importance for neural coding are poorly understood. Here we analyse the functional significance of correlated firing in a complete population of macaque parasol retinal ganglion cells using a model of multi-neuron spike responses4, 5. The model, with parameters fit directly to physiological data, simultaneously captures both the stimulus dependence and detailed spatio-temporal correlations in population responses, and provides two insights into the structure of the neural code. First, neural encoding at the population level is less noisy than one would expect from the variability of individual neurons: spike times are more precise, and can be predicted more accurately when the spiking of neighbouring neurons is taken into account. Second, correlations provide additional sensory information: optimal, model-based decoding that exploits the response correlation structure extracts 20\% more information about the visual scene than decoding under the assumption of independence, and preserves 40\% more visual information than optimal linear decoding6. This model-based approach reveals the role of correlated activity in the retinal coding of visual stimuli, and provides a general framework for understanding the importance of correlated activity in populations of neurons.}},

                Biological networks have so many possible states that exhaustive sampling is impossible. Successful analysis thus depends on simplifying hypotheses, but experiments on many systems hint that complicated, higher-order interactions among large groups of elements have an important role. Here we show, in the vertebrate retina, that weak correlations between pairs of neurons coexist with strongly collective behaviour in the responses of ten or more neurons. We find that this collective behaviour is described quantitatively by models that capture the observed pairwise correlations but assume no higher-order interactions. These maximum entropy models are equivalent to Ising models, and predict that larger networks are completely dominated by correlation effects. This suggests that the neural code has associative or error-correcting properties, and we provide preliminary evidence for such behaviour. As a first test for the generality of these ideas, we show that similar results are obtained from networks of cultured cortical neurons.

    abstract = {{Enactivism claims that sensory-motor activity and embodiment are crucial in perceiving the environment and that machine vision could be a much simpler business if considered in this context. However, computational models of enactive vision are very rare and often rely on handcrafted control systems. In this article, we argue that the apparent complexity of the environment and of the robot brain can be significantly simplified if perception, behavior, and learning are allowed to co-develop on the same timescale. In doing so, robots become sensitive to, and actively exploit, characteristics of the environment that they can tackle within their own computational and physical constraints. We describe the application of this methodology in three sets of experiments: shape discrimination, car driving, and wheeled robot navigation. A further set of experiments, where the visual system can develop the receptive fields by means of unsupervised Hebbian learning, demonstrates that the receptive fields are consistently and significantly affected by the behavior of the system and differ from those predicted by most computational models of the visual cortex. Finally, we show that our robots can also replicate the performance deficiencies observed in experiments of motor deprivation with kittens. 10.1177/1059712308089183}},

Consequently, many theories of motor function are based on 'optimal performance': they quantify task goals as cost functions, and apply the sophisticated tools of optimal control theory to obtain detailed behavioral predictions. The resulting models, although not without limitations, have explained more empirical phenomena than any other class. Traditional emphasis has been on optimizing desired movement trajectories while ignoring sensory feedback. Recent work has redefined optimality in terms of feedback control laws, and focused on the mechanisms that generate behavior online. This approach has allowed researchers to fit previously unrelated concepts and observations into what may become a unified theoretical framework for interpreting motor function. At the heart of the framework is the relationship between high-level goals, and the real-time sensorimotor control strategies most suitable for accomplishing those goals.}},

mostly synergistic - carrying information that is accessible only by observing

    abstract = {{To assess the information encoded in retinal spike trains and how it might be decoded by recipient neurons in the brain, we recorded from individual cat X and Y ganglion cells and visually stimulated them with randomly modulated patterns of various contrast and spatial configuration. For each pattern, we estimated the information rate of the cells using linear or nonlinear algorithms and for some patterns by directly measuring response probability distributions. We show that ganglion cell spike trains contain information from the receptive field center and surround, that the center and surround have similar signaling capacity, that antagonism between the mechanisms reduces information transmission, and that the total information rate is limited. We also show that a linear decoding algorithm can capture all of the information available in retinal spike trains about weak inputs, but it misses a substantial amount about strong inputs. For the strongest stimulus we used, the information rate of the best linear decoder averaged 40-70 bits/s across ganglion cell types, while the directly measured rate was around 20-40 bits/s greater. This implies that under certain stimulus conditions, visual information is encoded in the temporal structure of retinal spike trains and that a nonlinear decoding algorithm is needed to extract the temporally coded information. Using simulated spike trains, we demonstrate that much of the temporal structure may be explained by the threshold for spike generation and is not necessarily indicative of a complex coding scheme. 10.1152/jn.00796.2003}},

    abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Different types of retinal ganglion cells convey different messages to the brain. Messages are in the form of spike patterns, and the number of possible patterns per second sets the coding capacity. We asked if different ganglion cell types make equally efficient use of their coding capacity or whether efficiency depends on the message conveyed. RESULTS: We recorded spike trains from retinal ganglion cells in an in vitro preparation of the guinea pig retina. By calculating, for the observed spike rate, the number of possible spike patterns per second, we calculated coding capacity, and by counting the actual number of patterns, we estimated information rate. Cells with "brisk" responses, i.e., high firing rates, and a general message transmitted information at high rates (21 +/- 9 bits s(-1)). Cells with "sluggish" responses, i.e., lower firing rates, and specific messages (direction of motion, local-edge) transmitted information at lower rates (13 +/- 7 bits s(-1)). Yet, for every type of ganglion cell examined, the information rate was about one-third of coding capacity. For every ganglion cell, information rate was very close (within 4\%) to that predicted from Poisson noise and the cell's actual time-modulated rate. CONCLUSIONS: Different messages are transmitted with similar efficiency. Efficiency is limited by temporal correlations, but correlations may be essential to improve decoding in the presence of irreducible noise.}},

    abstract = {{The reasons for using natural stimuli to study sensory function are quickly mounting, as recent studies have revealed important differences in neural responses to natural and artificial stimuli. However, natural stimuli typically contain strong correlations and are spherically asymmetric (i.e. stimulus intensities are not symmetrically distributed around the mean), and these statistical complexities can bias receptive field (RF) estimates when standard techniques such as spike-triggered averaging or reverse correlation are used. While a number of approaches have been developed to explicitly correct the bias due to stimulus correlations, there is no complementary technique to correct the bias due to stimulus asymmetries. Here, we develop a method for RF estimation that corrects reverse correlation RF estimates for the spherical asymmetries present in natural stimuli. Using simulated neural responses, we demonstrate how stimulus asymmetries can bias reverse-correlation RF estimates (even for uncorrelated stimuli) and illustrate how this bias can be removed by explicit correction. We demonstrate the utility of the asymmetry correction method under experimental conditions by estimating RFs from the responses of retinal ganglion cells to natural stimuli and using these RFs to predict responses to novel stimuli.}},

                The timing of spiking activity across neurons is a fundamental aspect of the neural population code. Individual neurons in the retina, thalamus, and cortex can have very precise and repeatable responses but exhibit degraded temporal precision in response to suboptimal stimuli. To investigate the functional implications for neural populations in natural conditions, we recorded in vivo the simultaneous responses, to movies of natural scenes, of multiple thalamic neurons likely converging to a common neuronal target in primary visual cortex. We show that the response of individual neurons is less precise at lower contrast, but that spike timing precision across neurons is relatively insensitive to global changes in visual contrast. Overall, spike timing precision within and across cells is on the order of 10 ms. Since closely timed spikes are more efficient in inducing a spike in downstream cortical neurons, and since fine temporal precision is necessary to represent the more slowly varying natural environment, we argue that preserving relative spike timing at a approximately 10-ms resolution is a crucial property of the neural code entering cortex.

In the present study we found that when discriminating triangles from squares, rats did not use shape but instead relied on local luminance differences in the lower hemifield. A second experiment prevented this strategy by using stimuli—squares and rectangles—that varied in size and location, and for which the only constant predictor of reward was aspect ratio (ratio of height to width: a simple descriptor of  ” shape”). Rats eventually learned to use aspect ratio but only when no other discriminand was available, and performance remained very poor even at asymptote. These results suggest that although rats can process both dimensions simultaneously, they do not naturally solve shape discrimination tasks this way. This may reflect either a failure to visually process global shape information or a failure to discover shape as the discriminative stimulus in a simultaneous discrimination. Either way, our results suggest that simultaneous shape discrimination is not a good task for studies of visual perception in rodents.}},

Neurophysiol. 82: 301-311, 1999.[IMG]The rat is used widely to study various aspects of vision including developmental events and numerous pathologies, but surprisingly little is known about the functional properties of single neurons in the rat primary visual cortex (V1). These were investigated in the anesthetized (Hypnorm-Hypnovel), paralyzed animal by presenting gratings of different orientations, spatial and temporal frequencies, dimensions, and contrasts. Stimulus presentation and data collection were automated. Most neurons (190/205) showed sharply tuned ([\&lt;=]30{degrees} bandwidth at half height) orientation selectivity with a bias for horizontal stimuli (31\%). Analysis of response modulation of oriented cells showed a bimodal distribution consistent with the distinction between simple and complex cell types. Orientation specific interactions occurred between the center and the periphery of receptive fields, usually resulting in strong inhibition to center stimulation when both stimuli had the same orientation. There was no evidence for orientation columns nor for orderly change in optimal orientation with tangential tracks through V1. Responses were elicited by spatial frequencies ranging from zero (no grating) to 1.2 cycle/degree (c/{degrees}), peaking at 0.1 c/{degrees}, and with a modal cutoff of 0.6 c/{degrees}. Half of the neurons responded optimally to drifting gratings rather than flashing uniform field stimuli. Directional preference was seen for 59\% of oriented units at all depths in the cortex. Optimal stimuli velocities varied from 10 to 250{degrees}/s. Some units, mainly confined to layer 4, responded to velocities as high as 700{degrees}/s. Response versus contrast curves (best fit with Naka-Rushton) varied from nearly linear to extremely steep (mean contrast semisaturation 50\% and threshold 6\%). There was a trend for cells from superficial layers to be more selective to different stimulus parameters than deeper layers cells. We conclude that neurons in rat V1 have complex and diverse visual properties, necessary for precise visual form perception with low spatial resolution.},

    abstract = {{In mammalian neocortex, the orderly arrangement of columns of neurons is thought to be a fundamental organizing principle. In primary visual cortex (V1), neurons respond preferentially to bars of a particular orientation, and, in many mammals, these orientation-selective cells are arranged in a semiregular, smoothly varying map across the cortical surface. Curiously, orientation maps have not been found in rodents or lagomorphs. To explore whether this lack of organization in previously studied rodents could be attributable to low visual acuity, poorly differentiated visual brain areas, or small absolute V1 size, we examined V1 organization of a larger, highly visual rodent, the gray squirrel. Using intrinsic signal optical imaging and single-cell recordings, we found no evidence of an orientation map, suggesting that formation of orientation maps depends on mechanisms not found in rodents. We did find robust orientation tuning of single cells, and this tuning was invariant to stimulus contrast. Therefore, it seems unlikely that orientation maps are important for orientation tuning or its contrast invariance in V1. In vertical electrode penetrations, we found little evidence for columnar organization of orientation-selective neurons and little evidence for local anisotropy of orientation preferences. We conclude that an orderly and columnar arrangement of functional response properties is not a universal characteristic of cortical architecture. 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4042-04.2005}},

    abstract = {{
                The cerebral cortex, with its conserved 6-layer structure, has inspired many unifying models of function. However, recent comparative studies of primary visual cortex have revealed considerable structural diversity, raising doubts about the possibility of an all-encompassing theory. This review examines similarities and differences in V1 across mammals. Gross laminar interconnections are relatively conserved. Major functional response classes are found universally or nearly universally. Orientation and spatial frequency tuning bandwidths are quite similar despite an enormous range of visual resolution across species, and orientation tuning is contrast-invariant. Nevertheless, there is considerable diversity in the abundance of different cell classes, laminar organization, functional architecture, and functional connectivity. Orientation-selective responses arise in different layers in different species. Some mammals have elaborate columnar architecture like orientation maps and ocular dominance bands, but others lack this organization with no apparent impact on single cell properties. Finally, local functional connectivity varies according to map structure: similar cells are connected in smooth map regions but dissimilar cells are linked in animals without maps. If there is a single structure/function relation for cortex, it must accommodate significant variations in cortical circuitry. Alternatively, natural selection may craft unique circuits that function differently in each species.

    abstract = {{Neurons in the cerebral cortex are organized into anatomical columns, with ensembles of cells arranged from the surface to the white matter. Within a column, neurons often share functional properties, such as selectivity for stimulus orientation; columns with distinct properties, such as different preferred orientations, tile the cortical surface in orderly patterns. This functional architecture was discovered with the relatively sparse sampling of microelectrode recordings. Optical imaging of membrane voltage or metabolic activity elucidated the overall geometry of functional maps, but is averaged over many cells (resolution >100 m). Consequently, the purity of functional domains and the precision of the borders between them could not be resolved. Here, we labelled thousands of neurons of the visual cortex with a calcium-sensitive indicator in vivo. We then imaged the activity of neuronal populations at single-cell resolution with two-photon microscopy up to a depth of 400 m. In rat primary visual cortex, neurons had robust orientation selectivity but there was no discernible local structure; neighbouring neurons often responded to different orientations. In area 18 of cat visual cortex, functional maps were organized at a fine scale. Neurons with opposite preferences for stimulus direction were segregated with extraordinary spatial precision in three dimensions, with columnar borders one to two cells wide. These results indicate that cortical maps can be built with single-cell precision.}},

    abstract = {{Two major functions of the visual system are discussed and contrasted. One function of vision is the creation of an internal model or percept of the external world. Most research in object perception has concentrated on this aspect of vision. Vision also guides the control of object-directed action. In the latter case, vision directs our actions with respect to the world by transforming visual inputs into appropriate motor outputs. We argue that separate, but interactive, visual systems have evolved for the perception of objects on the one hand and the control of actions directed at those objects on the other. This 'duplex' approach to high-level vision suggests that Marrian or 'reconstructive' approaches and Gibsonian or 'purposive-animate-behaviorist' approaches need not be seen as mutually exclusive, but rather as complementary in their emphases on different aspects of visual function.}},

    abstract = {{To understand a neural circuit completely requires simultaneous recording from most of the neurons in that circuit. Here we report recording and spike sorting techniques that enable us to record from all or nearly all of the ganglion cells in a patch of the retina. With a dense multi-electrode array, each ganglion cell produces a unique pattern of activity on many electrodes when it fires an action potential. Signals from all of the electrodes are combined with an iterative spike sorting algorithm to resolve ambiguities arising from overlapping spike waveforms. We verify that we are recording from a large fraction of ganglion cells over the array by labeling the ganglion cells with a retrogradely transported dye and by comparing the number of labeled and recorded cells. Using these methods, we show that about 60 receptive fields of ganglion cells cover each point in visual space in the salamander, consistent with anatomical findings.}},

    abstract = {{In the classic "What the frog's eye tells the frog's brain," Lettvin and colleagues showed that different types of retinal ganglion cell send specific kinds of information. For example, one type responds best to a dark, convex form moving centripetally (a fly). Here we consider a complementary question: how much information does the retina send and how is it apportioned among different cell types? Recording from guinea pig retina on a multi-electrode array and presenting various types of motion in natural scenes, we measured information rates for seven types of ganglion cell. Mean rates varied across cell types (6-13 bits . s(-1)) more than across stimuli. Sluggish cells transmitted information at lower rates than brisk cells, but because of trade-offs between noise and temporal correlation, all types had the same coding efficiency. Calculating the proportions of each cell type from receptive field size and coverage factor, we conclude (assuming independence) that the approximately 10(5) ganglion cells transmit on the order of 875,000 bits . s(-1). Because sluggish cells are equally efficient but more numerous, they account for most of the information. With approximately 10(6) ganglion cells, the human retina would transmit data at roughly the rate of an Ethernet connection.}},

    abstract = {{Pattern recognition is one of the most important tasks of the visual system, and uncovering the neural mechanisms underlying recognition phenomena has been a focus of researchers for decades. Surprisingly, at the earliest stages of vision, the retina is capable of highly sophisticated temporal pattern recognition. We stimulated the retina of tiger salamander (Ambystoma tigrinum) with periodic dark flash sequences and found that retinal ganglion cells had a wide variety of different responses to a periodic flash sequence with many firing when a flash was omitted. The timing of the omitted stimulus response (OSR) depended on the period, with individual cells tracking the stimulus period down to increments of 5 ms. When flashes occurred earlier than expected, cells updated their expectation of the next flash time by as much as 50 ms. When flashes occurred later than expected, cells fired an OSR and reset their temporal expectation to the average time interval between flashes. Using pharmacology to investigate the retinal circuitry involved, we found that inhibitory transmission from amacrine cells was not required, but ON bipolar cells were required. The results suggest a mechanism in which the intrinsic resonance of ON bipolars leads to the OSR in ganglion cells. We discuss the implications of retinal pattern recognition on the neural code of the retina and visual processing in general. 10.1152/jn.01025.2007}},
