				the camera. In order for calibration to be possible some constraints must be placed on the
				calibration of each image. The method works under the minimal assumption of zero-skew

				corresponding to a micro-column, is about 50\mu m. The proposed model takes into account
				biological and electrical neural parameters of the laminar cortical layers. Thus we choose a
				model based on a cortical microcircuit, whose synaptic connections are made only between six
				specific populations of neurons, excitatory and inhibitory neurons in three main layers,
				following [3] and [1]. For each neuron, we use a conductance-based single compartment
				Hodgkin-Huxley neuron model [4]. We claim that our model will reproduce qualitatively the same
				results than the optical imaging signal based on voltage-sensitive dyes, which represents the
				summed intracellular membrane potential changes of all the neuronal elements at a given cortical
				site [2]. Furthermore, this voltage-sensitive dye imaging has a submillisecond temporal
				resolution that allows us to explore the dynamics of cortical processing. An example of data of
				V1 dye-signal in a cat, after a visual local stimulation, is shown in Figure 1. Therefore, the
				temporal dynamics of the measured signal will be carefully studied as being of primary interest
				for the proposed model identification.},

				center--surround interactions enriches motion representation and improves the action recognition
				performance. To do so, we propose a simplified bio--inspired model of the motion pathway in
				primates: It is a feedforward model restricted to V1-MT cortical layers, cortical cells cover
				the visual space with a foveated structure, and more importantly, we reproduce some of the
				richness of center-surround interactions of MT cells. Interestingly, as observed in
				neurophysiology, our MT cells not only behave like simple velocity detectors, but also respond
				to several kinds of motion contrasts. Results show that this diversity of motion representation
				at the MT level is a major advantage for an action recognition task. Defining motion maps as our
				feature vectors, we used a standard classification method on the Weizmann database: We obtained
				an average recognition rate of 98.9%, which is superior to the recent results by Jhuang et al.
				(2007). These promising results encourage us to further develop bio--inspired models
				incorporating other brain mechanisms and cortical layers in order to deal with more complex
				videos.},

				descriptions are unaffected by the viewpoint or the camera parameters. We show, using images of

				to fast and effective recognition of curved surfaces. The techniques we describe work for
				surfaces that have a rotational symmetry, or are projectively equivalent to a surface with a
				rotational symmetry, and can be extended to an even larger class of surfaces. All the results in
				this paper are for the case of full perspective. The results additionally yield techniques for

				Physiology - Paris 97 379 - 385) that such a mechanism could provide an abstract view of brain's
				segmentation. Following this track, we 'implement' segmentation, using a retinotopical neuron
				network. In our approach, the first step is to consider a discrete approximation of the Mumford
				Shah functional (Chambolle, 1999 Mathematical Modelling and Numerical Analysis 33 261 - 288),
				yielding a dynamical system grid. We then explore different possibilities to link it to a grid
				of neurons, the processed value being directly the phase, the membrane voltage, or a more
				complex neuron state evaluation, all this depending on the considered neuron model (from
				integrate and fire to Hodgkin - Huxley) and encoding (with its phase, membrane voltage, or
				spiking rate). Using this theoretical study and the related numerical experiment, we are able to
				compare these alternatives, while an original biologically inspired segmentation network emerges
				from our study. [Work conducted within the scope of the European project FACETS

				shortcomings in regions of fiber-crossings. HARDI models such as QBI and Higher Order Tensors
				(HOT) were in- vented to overcome this shortcoming. HOTs, however, have not been explored
				extensively even though sophisticated estimation schemes were developed for DTI that guarantee
				positive diffusivity, such as the Rie- mannian framework. Positive diffusivity is an important
				constraint in diffusion MRI since it represents the physical phenomenon of molecular diffusion.
				It seems apt, to leverage the work done on DTI, to apply the positivity constraint to the HOT
				model. We, therefore, propose to extend the Riemannian framework from DTI to the space of 4th
				order diffusion tensors. We also review the existing methods for estimating 4th order diffusion
				tensors and compare all methods on synthetic, phantom and real datasets extensively to test for
				robustness and speed. Our contributions for extending the Riemannian framework from DTI to
				estimating 4th order diffusion tensors guarantees positive diffusivity, is robust, is fast, and
				can be used to discern multiple fiber directions.},

				given the activity of a brain area. If biological neural network information is mainly related
				to the synaptic input (thus to the membrane potential in this case), it is however usually
				modeled by high-level representation of the related processing. For example, in Vi{\'e}ville,
				Kornprobst (2006), the authors revisit the link between variational approaches, local diffusion
				mechanisms, and neural networks. This allows to relate the observed activity with certain
				classes of underlying computations (e.g.: early-vision processes, winner-take-all mechanisms,
				..). With this formalism, we propose to evaluate, given the activity of a spiking network
				measured using optical-imaging (here during the observation of V1), which is the underlying
				diffusion process. This is a highly constrained meso-scopic model of the neuronal activity,
				likely more robust to estimate than in a less specific case. Considering a very simple
				experimental paradigm, we analyze if the precision of the data is sufficient to estimate
				robustly the underlying diffusion mechanisms. More generaly, we propose to estimate the required
				precision in terms of scale and dynamics for such a reverse-engineering paradigm to be valid.},

				input allows to link ``what is to be done'' (perceptual task) with ``how to do it'' (neural
				network calculation). We show how to define the perceptual task as a an optimization problem,
				and then we derive the related neural network parameters considering regularization mechanisms.
				The present contribution make this framework explicit for a general class of vectorial,
				non-linear map computations. Using a scalar or vector valued map is an important feature when
				addressing the modelization of cortical processing units such as cortical columns. Introducing
				non-linear constraints between the map components has several advantages, one is to take noisy
				measures into account, avoiding statistical bias, another is to define physical parameters with
				complex structure (e.g. 3D orientation). In our context, we consider that neural network
				information is mainly conveyed through spikes, and derive the spiking network parameters which
				implements the formalized processing. We consider SRM neurons with piece-wise linear kernels and
				experiment to which extends neuronal computations such as winner-take-all or non-linear
				filtering via anisotropic-adaptative-diffusion are well formalized in such a context.},

				two anatomical volumes~\cite{Brown-CS92} but none of them introduce geometric constraints on the

				context that decreasing the number of dof improves the numerical stability of the displacement
				recovery algorithm \cite{vieville-lingrand:99,lingrand:00d} by regularizing the minimized
				criterion and reducing the number of local minima. We developed a strategy adapted to the case
				of human head displacement in a MRI scanner. This algorithm has been successfully tested on 6
				sets of fMRI volumes acquired at the MNI on different patients. Each set is composed of 30 to 78

				invariants have been implemented. A key example is the LEWIS system. Lewis exploits projective
				invariants of planar objects to enable object indexing and classification. Experience with LEWIS
				and its limitations, motivated MORSE. The MORSE project, started in January 1994, has the goal
				of providing a C++ environment for the implementation of a system for recognizing 3D objects
				based on invariant class descriptions. MORSE embodies invariant representations for geometric
				classes of 3D objects such as: rotational symmetry, translational symmetry and polyhedra. The
				architecture is designed to support image segmentation, class-based grouping, model library
				management and scene reasoning. The LEWIS system has also been re-implemented using the MORSE
				infrastructure to provide for recognition of planar objects.}

				matrix between a pair of images projectively constrains the associated camera matrices to a
				closed-form four degree of freedom family of solutions. The elements of this family are related
				by a sub-group of the projective group, and so the camera geometries can be computed up to a
				projective deformation of three-dimensional space. Including a third camera in the description,
				or any additional camera after that, does not yield any extra ambiguity. In experiments with
				real images we have found that the parametrization performs well, and compares more than

				demonstrate that the invariant measures, derived from the canonical frame, provide sufficient
				discrimination between objects to be useful for recognition. Recognition is of partially
				occluded objects in cluttered scenes. Secondly, jigsaw puzzles are assembled and rendered from a

				solve classical aperture problem and also to estimate velocity maps on complex scenes such as
				transparent motion or motion occlusion. Local motion estimation is solved through a recurrent V1
				- MT process (Bayerl and Neumann, 2007 International Journal of Computer Vision 72 27 - 45).
				However, feedback diffusion is controlled via a second recurrent network (V1 - V2 like) that
				estimates local form information on a different spatial scale. We investigate how this
				architecture can reveal some integrative centre - surround MT cell properties (Huang et al, 2007
				Neuron 53 761 - 770). We evaluate our model on several synthetic and real sequences against both
				neuronal and psychophysical data on the dynamics of motion integration. [Supported in part by

				and computer vision applications. In this paper, a novel, unified optical flow estimation method
				is developed for simultaneously tackling aperture problem and multiple motions, and
				consequently, yielding more accurate optical flow estimation. By integrating Gaussian
				scale-space with 3D structure tensor, the estimation difficulty encountered in multiple motions
				resulted from multiple video objects has been handled reasonably well. The obtained normal flow
				are then treated separately from the real flow, by further applying the least-squares
				estimation, with assist of automatic scale selection mechanism, to produce the estimated real
				flow. Our proposed automatic scale selection for spatial scale-space is developed from the
				viewpoint of numerical stability, and the condition number is exploited for adaptively choosing
				local scales (window sizes). For performance evaluation, we adopted the angular error as the
				quantitative measurement and using several benchmark image sequences. Experimental results show
				that the accuracy of our optical flow estimation method is superior to several leading
				algorithms.}

				reconstructed points. The last one has a better statistical interpretation, but is, however,
				much slower than the first two. In this paper, we show that the last two criteria are equivalent
				when the epipoles are at infinity, and differ from each other only a little even when the
				epipoles are in the image. The first two criteria are equivalent only when the epipoles are at
				infinity and when the observed object has the same scale in the two images. This suggests that
				the second criterion is sufficient in practice because of its computational efficiency. The
				result is valid for both calibrated and uncalibrated images. }

				it is unaffected by camera {\em intrinsic} parameters, so calibration is not required; second,
				is it also unaffected by camera motion ({\em extrinsic parameters}) so viewer motion (or
				epipolar geometry for stereo) need not be known; and third, curves need not be matched point by
				point. The method involves recovering structure modulo a 3D affine or projective transformation.
				Tests on this relative structure classify the curve into its qualitative type. The practical

				that a geometric class defined in 3D induces relationships in the image which must hold between
				points on the image outline (the perspective projection of the object). The resulting image
				constraints enable both identification and grouping of image features belonging to objects of
				that class. The classes include surfaces of revolution, canal surfaces (pipes) and polyhedra.
				Recognition proceeds by first recognising an object as belonging to one of the classes (for
				example a surface of revolution) and subsequently identifying the object (for example as a
				particular vase). This differs from conventional object recognition systems where recognition is
				generally targetted at particular objects. These classes also support the computation of 3D
				invariant descriptions including symmetry axes, canonical coordinate frames and projective
				signatures. The constraints and grouping methods are viewpoint invariant, and proceed with no
				information on object pose. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this class-based grouping on
				real, cluttered scenes using grouping algorithms developed for rotationally symmetric surfaces,
				canal-surfaces and polyhedra.}

				bounded variation whose distributional derivatives are in a certain sense absolutely continuous
				with respect to the Lebesgue measure on $\bbfR\sp n$ plus an $(n-1)$-dimensional Hausdorff
				measure. The author then proves that functionals of a given type, which have many applications
				in the areas mentioned above, have minimisers in the class of generalised functions of bounded

				develops several properties of the pairing $<\psi,u>$ and $<\psi,Du>$. The author obtains a
				formula of integral representation for $<\psi,u>$, shows that $<\psi,Du>$ is a Radon measure on
				$\Omega$, absolutely continuous with respect to the measure $\vert Du\vert$ on $\Omega$ and
				establishes the relation (Green formula) between the measure $<\psi,Du>$ and the function
				$<\psi,\nu >$ where $\nu$ (x) denotes the outward unit normal to $\partial \Omega$. In section
				2, the author is concerned with the representation of the density $\theta$ ($\psi$,Du) of the
				measure $<\psi,Du>$ with respect to the measure $\vert Du\vert$. Other properties of the
				function $\theta$ ($\psi$,Du) are developed. In section 3, the author studies the pairing
				$<\psi,\mu >$ when $\mu$ is a measure whose curl is also a measure and presents some properties
				of $<\psi,\mu >$ analogously as in section 1 and section 2. Finally a sequential continuity
				result of the bilinear mapping $(\psi,\mu)\mapsto <\psi,\mu >$ is established in M($\Omega)$.}

				current-voltage (I-V) relationships during application of current or voltage steps. Here we
				demonstrate the measurement of a novel I-V curve measured while the neuron exhibits a
				fluctuating voltage and emits spikes. This dynamic I-V curve requires only a few tens of seconds
				of experimental time and so lends itself readily to the rapid classification of cell type,
				quantification of heterogeneities in cell populations, and generation of reduced analytical
				models. We apply this technique to layer-5 pyramidal cells and show that their dynamic I-V curve
				comprises linear and exponential components, providing experimental evidence for a recently
				proposed theoretical model. The approach also allows us to determine the change of neuronal
				response properties after a spike, millisecond by millisecond, so that postspike refractoriness
				of pyramidal cells can be quantified. Observations of I-V curves during and in absence of
				refractoriness are cast into a model that is used to predict both the subthreshold response and
				spiking activity of the neuron to novel stimuli. The predictions of the resulting model are in
				excellent agreement with experimental data and close to the intrinsic neuronal reproducibility
				to repeated stimuli.},

				different feature detecting parallel representations (Nature 2001; 410:583-587). Our CNN model
				is capable of reproducing qualitatively the same full set of space-time patterns as the living
				retina in response to a flashed square. The modelling framework can then be used to predict the
				set of retinal responses to more complex patterns and is also applicable to studies of the other
				biological sensory systems. The work represents a major step forward in the complexity and
				programmability of retinal models.}

				procedure greatly facilitates the iterative solution of the problem and overcomes the divergence
				encountered by other authors. Numerical solutions obtained for simple geometries are compared to
				the exact analytic solutions available in such cases. The necessary convergence of the solutions
				of the discrete analog towards the solution of the continuous problem is shown to occur only if
				the coefficients of the discrete analogue are carefully evaluated. Calculations are then
				presented for realistic thoracic geometries, typical results being presented as surface
				potential maps. Finally the important effect of the internal regional inhomogeneities,
				particularly a realistic cardiac blood mass, is demonstrated by obtaining vector loops with and
				without these effects.}

  annote		      = {A vivid perception of the moving form of a human figure can be obtained from a few moving light
				points on the joints of the body. This is known as biological motion perception. It is commonly
				believed that the perception of biological motion rests on image motion signals. Curiously,
				however, some patients with lesions to motion processing areas of the dorsal stream are severely
				impaired in image motion perception but can easily perceive biological motion. Here we describe
				a biological motion stimulus based on a limited lifetime technique that tests the perception of
				a moving human figure in the absence of local image motion. We find that subjects can
				spontaneously recognize a moving human figure in displays without local image motion. Their
				performance is very similar to that for classic point-light displays. We also find that tasks
				involving the discrimination of walking direction or the coherence of a walking figure can be

				correlates of perceived brightness. The perceived brightness of a center grating was changed by
				varying the orientation or the relative spatial phase of a surrounding grating. Brightness
				enhancement by orientation contrast is associated with an increase of discharge rates of
				responses to the center grating but not with changes in spike synchronization. In contrast, if
				brightness enhancement is induced by phase offset, discharge rates are unchanged but
				synchronization increases between neurons responding to the center grating. The changes in
				synchronization correlate well with changes in perceived brightness that were assessed in
				parallel in human subjects using the same stimuli. These results indicate that in cerebral
				cortex the modulation of synchronicity of responses is used as a mechanism complementary to rate
				changes to enhance the saliency of neuronal responses.}

				processing. To localise the human brain mechanisms involved in this performance, functional
				magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to compare brain activation during viewing of
				coherently moving random dots with that during viewing spatially and temporally comparable
				dynamic noise. Rates of reversal of coherent motion and coherent-motion velocities (5 versus 20
				deg s-1) were also compared. Differences in local activation between conditions were analysed by
				statistical parametric mapping. Greater activation by coherent motion compared to noise was
				found in V5 and putative V3A, but not in V1. In addition there were foci of activation on the
				occipital ventral surface, the intraparietal sulcus, and superior temporal sulcus. Thus,
				coherent-motion information has distinctive effects in a number of extrastriate visual brain
				areas. The rate of motion reversal showed only weak effects in motion-sensitive areas. V1 was
				better activated by noise than by coherent motion, possibly reflecting activation of neurons
				with a wider range of motion selectivities. This activation was at a more anterior location in
				the comparison of noise with the faster velocity, suggesting that 20 deg s-1 is beyond the
				velocity range of the V1 representation of central visual field. These results support the use
				of motion-coherence tests for extrastriate as opposed to V1 function. However, sensitivity to
				motion coherence is not confined to V5, and may extend beyond the classically defined dorsal
				stream.}

				In many situations, especially in vivo, the traditional limitation of such recordings is the

				based on a digital model of the electrode interfaced in real time with the electrophysiological
				setup. The characteristics of this model are first estimated using white noise current
				injection. The electrode and membrane contribution are digitally separated, and the recording is
				then made by online subtraction of the electrode contribution. Tests performed in vitro and in
				vivo demonstrate that AEC enables high-frequency recordings in demanding conditions, such as
				injection of conductance noise in dynamic-clamp mode, not feasible with a single high-resistance
				electrode until now. AEC should be particularly useful to characterize fast neuronal phenomena
				intracellularly in vivo.},

				provide a series of benchmark simulations of different types of networks of spiking neurons,
				including Hodgkin-Huxley type, integrate-and-fire models, interacting with current-based or
				conductance-based synapses, using clock-driven or event-driven integration strategies. The same

				this method removes noise it creates blur. Hence, neighborhood filters are usually preferred.
				These filters perform an average of neighboring pixels, but only under the condition that their
				grey level is close enough to the one of the pixel in restoration. This very popular method
				unfortunately creates shocks and staircasing effects. In this paper, we perform an asymptotic
				analysis of neighborhood filters as the size of the neighborhood shrinks to zero. We prove that
				these filters are asymptotically equivalent to the Perona--Malik equation, one of the first
				nonlinear PDE's proposed for image restoration. As a solution, we propose an extremely simple
				variant of the neighborhood filter using a linear regression instead of an average. By analyzing
				its subjacent PDE, we prove that this variant does not create shocks: it is actually related to
				the mean curvature motion. We extend the study to more general local polynomial estimates of the
				image in a grey level neighborhood and introduce two new fourth order evolution equations.},

				the strengths and weaknesses of a number of semi-local methods are compared on the basis of the
				same images and edge data. All the methods define a distinguished or canonical projective frame
				for the curve segment which is used for projective normalisation. In this canonical frame the
				curve has a viewpoint invariant signature. Measurements on the signature are invariants. All the
				methods presented are designed to work on real images where extracted data will not be ideal,
				and parts of curves will be missing because of poor contrast or occlusion. We compare the
				stability and discrimination of the signatures and invariants over a number of example curve and
				viewpoints. The paper concludes with a discussion of how the various methods can be integrated
				within a recognition system. }

				this generalization might be accomplished by an extraction of simple midlevel optic flow
				features within coarse spatial arrangement, potentially exploiting relatively simple neural
				circuits: (1) A statistical analysis of the most informative mid-level features reveals that
				normal and point-light walkers share very similar dominant local optic flow features. (2) We
				devise a novel point-light stimulus (critical features stimulus) that contains these features,
				and which is perceived as a human walker even though it is inconsistent with the skeleton of the
				human body. (3) A neural model that extracts only these critical features accounts for
				substantial recognition rates for strongly degraded stimuli. We conclude that recognition of
				biological motion might be accomplished by detecting mid-level optic flow features with
				relatively coarse spatial localization. The computationally challenging reconstruction of
				precise position information from degraded stimuli might not be required.}

				level-set representation for curves constrained to lie o n surfaces. We study primarily
				geometrically based motions of these curves on stationary surfaces while allowing topological
				changes in the curves (i.e., mergin g and breaking) to occur. Applications include finding
				geodesic curves and short est paths and curve shortening on surfaces. Further applications can
				be arrived at by extending those for curves moving in R2 to surfaces. The problem of moving
				curves on surfaces can also be viewed as a simple constraint problem and may be useful in
				studying more difficult versions. Results show that our representatio n can accurately handle
				many geometrically based motions of curves on a wide var iety of surfaces while automatically
				enforcing topological changes in the curves when they occur and automatically fixing the curves
				to lie on the surfaces. The method can also be easily extended to higher dimensions.}

				introduced by Cohen (1991) as a way to generalize and solve some of the problems encountered
				with the original method. A 3-D generalization of the balloon model as a 3-D deformable surface,
				which evolves in 3-D images, is presented. It is deformed under the action of internal and
				external forces attracting the surface toward detected edgels by means of an attraction
				potential. We also show properties of energy-minimizing surfaces concerning their relationship
				with 3-D edge points. To solve the minimization problem for a surface, two simplified approaches
				are shown first, defining a 3-D surface as a series of 2-D planar curves. Then, after comparing
				finite-element method and finite-difference method in the 2-D problem, we solve the 3-D model
				using the finite-element method yielding greater stability and faster convergence. This model is
				applied for segmenting magnetic resonance images.}

				5 ms of step onset. IA was antagonized by external tetraethylammonium or 4-aminopyridine, and by
				intracellular caesium. The second population expressed a delayed rectifying potassium current
				(IK) that reached peak amplitude > 10 ms after step onset and did not inactivate. IK was
				antagonized by internal caesium and external tetraethylammonium. Bipolar cells expressing IK
				also expressed a time-dependent h-current at membrane potentials < - 50 mV. Ih was sensitive to
				external caesium and barium, and was also reduced by Na+-free Ringer. In both groups, a calcium
				current (ICa) and a calcium-dependent potassium current (IK(Ca)) were identified. Depolarizing
				voltage steps > - 50 mV activated ICa, which reached peak amplitude between - 20 and - 10 mV.
				ICa was eliminated in Ca+2-free Ringer and blocked by cadmium and cobalt, but not tetrodotoxin.
				In most cells, ICa was transient, activating rapidly at - 50 mV. This current was antagonized by
				nickel. The remaining bipolar cells expressed a nifedipine-sensitive sustained current that
				activated between - 40 and - 30 mV, with both slower kinetics and smaller amplitude than
				transient ICa. IK(Ca) was elicited by membrane depolarizations > - 20 mV. Bipolar cells in the
				zebrafish retinal slice preparation express an array of voltage-gated currents which contribute
				to non-linear I-V characteristics. The zebrafish retinal slice preparation is well-suited to
				patch clamp analyses of membrane mechanisms and provides a suitable model for studying genetic
				defects in visual system development.}

				maps and second-order twobar interaction maps for 65 simple and 124 complex direction-selective
				cells in alert macaque V1. Spatial and temporal phase differences between light and dark
				space-time maps clearly distinguished simple and complex cell populations. Complex cells usually
				showed similar direction preferences to light and dark bars, but many of the directional simple
				cells were much more direction selective to one sign of contrast than the reverse. We show that
				this is predicted by a simple energy model. Some of the direction-selective simple cells showed
				multiple space-time-slanted subregions, but others (previously described as S1 cells) had
				space-time maps that looked like just one subregion of an ordinary simple cell. Both simple and
				complex cells showed directional interactions (nonlinearities) to pairs of flashed bars (a 2-bar
				apparent-motion stimulus). The space-time slant of the simple cells correlated with the optimum
				dX/dT (velocity) of the paired-bar interactions. Some complex cells also showed a space-time
				slant; the direction of the slant usually correlated with the preferred direction of motion, but
				the degree of slant correlated with the inferred velocity tuning only when measured by a
				weighted-centroid calculation. Principal components analysis of the simple-cell space-time maps
				yielded one fast temporally biphasic component and a slower temporally monophasic component. We
				saw no consistent pattern for the spatial phase of the components, unlike previous reports;
				however, we show that principal components analysis may not distinguish between spatial offsets
				and phase offsets.}

				information contained in the time course of individual voxels. Multivariate analyses can take
				advantage of the information contained in activity patterns across space, from multiple voxels.
				Such analyses have the potential to greatly expand the amount of information extracted from fMRI
				data sets. In the present study, multivariate statistical pattern recognition methods, including
				linear discriminant analysis and support vector machines, were used to classify patterns of fMRI
				activation evoked by the visual presentation of various categories of objects. Classifiers were
				trained using data from voxels in predefined regions of interest during a subset of trials for
				each subject individually. Classification of subsequently collected fMRI data was attempted
				according to the similarity of activation patterns to prior training examples. Classification
				was done using only small amounts of data (20 s worth) at a time, so such a technique could, in
				principle, be used to extract information about a subject's percept on a near real-time basis.
				Classifiers trained on data acquired during one session were equally accurate in classifying
				data collected within the same session and across sessions separated by more than a week, in the
				same subject. Although the highest classification accuracies were obtained using patterns of
				activity including lower visual areas as input, classification accuracies well above chance were
				achieved using regions of interest restricted to higher-order object-selective visual areas. In
				contrast to typical fMRI data analysis, in which hours of data across many subjects are averaged
				to reveal slight differences in activation, the use of pattern recognition methods allows a
				subtle 10-way discrimination to be performed on an essentially trial-by-trial basis within
				individuals, demonstrating that fMRI data contain far more information than is typically
				appreciated. }

				efficient algorithms in terms of CPU time, but reaches its limits since the energy associated
				with shape from shading can contain multiple deep local minima. We derive an alternative
				stochastic approach using simulated annealing. The obtained results strongly outperform the
				results of the deterministic approach. The shortcoming is an extreme slowness of the
				optimization. Therefore, we propose a hybrid approach which combines the deterministic and

				also establish a connection between fuzzy set theory and robust statistics, and point out the
				similarities between robust clustering methods and statistical methods such as the weighted
				least-squares technique, the M estimator, the minimum volume ellipsoid algorithm, cooperative
				robust estimation, minimization of probability of randomness, and the epsilon contamination
				model. By gleaning the common principles upon which the methods proposed in the literature are
				based, we arrive at a unified view of robust clustering methods. We define several general
				concepts that are useful in robust clustering,state the robust clustering problem in terms of
				the defined concepts, and propose generic algorithms and guidelines for clustering noisy data.
				We also discuss why the generalized Hough transform is a suboptimal solution to the robust
				clustering problem. }

				those with a fast very biphasic temporal response. These two sub-populations are in temporal
				quadrature, the fast biphasic cells crossing over from one response phase to the reverse just as
				the slow monophasic cells reach their peak response. The two sub-populations also differ in the

				and the other the temporal and spatial characteristics of a slow monophasic cell. Magnocellular

				many functions such as action, perception, learning, language, and cognition. Its structural
				architecture has been studied for more than a hundred years; however, its dynamics have been
				addressed much less thoroughly. In this paper, we review and integrate, in a unifying framework,
				a variety of computational approaches that have been used to characterize the dynamics of the
				cortex, as evidenced at different levels of measurement. Computational models at different
				space--time scales help us understand the fundamental mechanisms that underpin neural processes
				and relate these processes to neuroscience data. Modeling at the single neuron level is
				necessary because this is the level at which information is exchanged between the computing
				elements of the brain; the neurons. Mesoscopic models tell us how neural elements interact to
				yield emergent behavior at the level of microcolumns and cortical columns. Macroscopic models
				can inform us about whole brain dynamics and interactions between large-scale neural systems
				such as cortical regions, the thalamus, and brain stem. Each level of description relates
				uniquely to neuroscience data, from single-unit recordings, through local field potentials to
				functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), electroencephalogram (EEG), and
				magnetoencephalogram (MEG). Models of the cortex can establish which types of large-scale
				neuronal networks can perform computations and characterize their emergent properties.
				Mean-field and related formulations of dynamics also play an essential and complementary role as
				forward models that can be inverted given empirical data. This makes dynamic models critical in
				integrating theory and experiments. We argue that elaborating principled and informed models is
				a prerequisite for grounding empirical neuroscience in a cogent theoretical framework,
				commensurate with the achievements in the physical sciences.},

				method is appropriate to propagate through regions of fiber crossings and we show that our
				results outperform state-of-the-art diffusion tensor (DT) imaging segmentation methods,
				inherently limited by the DT model. Results obtained on synthetic data, on a biological phantom,
				on real datasets and on all 13 subjects of a public NMR database show that our method is
				reproducible, automatic and brings a strong added value to diffusion MRI segmentation.},

				using functional magnetic resonance imaging. V5 was significantly activated in 19 hemispheres
				with alternating, low contrast, random checkerboard patterns. We confirmed the stereotaxic
				location of V5 and were able to describe a fairly consistent sulcal pattern in the
				parieto-temporo-occipital cortex. V5 was usually (95\%) buried within a sulcus, most commonly
				within the inferior temporal sulcus (ITS) (11\%), the ascending limb of the ITS (ALITS) (53\%)
				and the posterior continuation of the ITS (26\%). The average distance from V5 of two identified
				anatomical landmarks of V5, the junctions of the LO and the ALITS, and the ITS and ALITS, were
				both ~1 cm. However, the LO-ALITS junction often had to be determined by interpolation (47\%),
				and was not always present even with interpolation (21\%). In contrast, the ITS-ALITS junction
				was always present and V5 was usually (90\%) located in a sulcus intersecting with this
				junction, making it a more reliable landmark for localizing V5 with respect to gross
				morphological features on individual cortical surfaces. }

				have been studied by measuring both magnitude and phase of the responses of these cells to
				drifting or sinusoidally contrast-modulated sinusoidal grating patterns. It has been
				demonstrated not only that X cells behave approximately linearly when responding with amplitudes
				of less than about 10 impulses/sec to stimuli of low contrast but also that cells of another
				type with larger receptive field centres (Q cells) behave approximately linearly under the same
				conditions. These Q cells appear to form a homogeneous group which is probably a subset of the
				tonic W cells (Stone \& Fukuda, 1974) or sluggish centre-surround cells (Cleland \& Levick,
				1974). The over-all spatio-temporal frequency characteristics of cells showing linear spatial
				summation are not separable in space and time. The form of the spatial frequency responsivity
				function of these cells depends upon the temporal frequency at which it is measured while the
				temporal phase of their resonse measured at any constant temporal frequency depends upon the
				spatial frequency of the stimulus. The behaviour of X and Q cells is quite well explained by an
				extension of the model in which signals from centre and surround mechanisms with radially
				Gaussian weighting functions are summed to provide the drive to the retinal ganglion cell. While
				the general form of the temporal frequency response characteristics of these ganglion cells are
				probably provided by the characteristics of elements common to the centre and surround pathways,
				the spatio-temporal interactions can be explained by assuming that the surround signal is
				delayed relative to the centre signal by a few milliseconds.}}}

				pairs in cat primary visual cortex exhibited correlated fluctuations in response latency,
				particularly when they had overlapping receptive fields or similar orientation preferences.
				Correlations occurred within and across hemispheres, but only when local field potentials (LFPs)
				oscillated in the gamma-frequency range (40-70 Hz). In this range, LFP fluctuations preceding
				response onset predicted response latencies; negative (positive) LFPs were associated with early
				(late) responses. Oscillations below 10 Hz caused covariations in response amplitude, but
				exhibited no columnar selectivity or coordinating effect on latencies. Thus, during high gamma
				activity, spontaneous activity exhibits distinct, column-specific correlation patterns.
				Consequently, cortical cells undergo coherent fluctuations in excitability that enhance temporal
				coherence of responses to contours that are spatially contiguous or have similar orientation.
				Because synchronized responses are more likely than dispersed responses to undergo rapid and
				joint processing, spontaneous activity may be important in early visual processes.}

				these functionals converge to the Mumford-Shah functional both in the sense of pointwise
				convergence and of $\Gamma$-convergence. Together with a compactness result, this implies the
				convergence of the corresponding minimum points.}

				when a biological motion stimuli is shown (point-light figures). Abstract: These experiments use
				functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to reveal neural activity uniquely associated with
				perception of biological motion. We isolated brain areas activated during the viewing of
				point-light figures, then compared those areas to regions known to be involved in
				coherent-motion perception and kinetic-boundary perception. Coherent motion activated a region
				matching previous reports of human MT/MST complex located on the temporo-parietooccipital
				junction. Kinetic boundaries activated a region posterior and adjacent to human MT previously
				identified as the kinetic-occipital (KO) region or the lateral-occipital (LO) complex. The
				pattern of activation during viewing of biological motion was located within a small region on
				the ventral bank of the occipital extent of the superior-temporal sulcus (STS). This region is
				located lateral and anterior to human MT/MST, and anterior to KO. Among our observers, we
				localized this region more frequently in the right hemisphere than in the left. This was true
				regardless of whether the point-light figures were presented in the right or left hemifield. A
				small region in the medial cerebellum was also active when observers viewed biological-motion
				sequences. Consistent with earlier neuroimaging and single-unit studies, this pattern of results
				points to the existence of neural mechanisms specialized for analysis of the kinematics defining
				biological motion.}

				encode local differences in space and changes in time rather than the raw image intensity. This
				can be seen as a strategy of predictive coding, adapted through evolution to the average image
				statistics of the natural environment. Yet animals encounter many environments with visual
				statistics different from the average scene. Here we show that when this happens, the retina
				adjusts its processing dynamically. The spatio-temporal receptive fields of retinal ganglion
				cells change after a few seconds in a new environment. The changes are adaptive, in that the new
				receptive field improves predictive coding under the new image statistics. We show that a
				network model with plastic synapses can account for the large variety of observed adaptations.}

				receptive field size, we established a double dissociation between two distinct MT+ subregions
				in 8 of the 10 hemispheres studied. The first subregion exhibited retinotopic organization but
				did not respond to peripheral ipsilateral stimulation, indicative of smaller receptive fields.
				Conversely, the second subregion within MT+ did not demonstrate retinotopic organization but did
				respond to peripheral stimuli in both the ipsilateral and contralateral visual hemifields,
				indicative of larger receptive fields. We tentatively identify these subregions as the human
				homologues of macaque MT and MST, respectively. Putative human MT and MST were typically located
				on the posterior/ventral and anterior/dorsal banks of a dorsal/posterior limb of the inferior
				temporal sulcus, similar to their relative positions in the macaque superior temporal sulcus. }

				enhancement in the retina is thought to be mediated by classical center-surround antagonism,
				first encountered as the interactions between horizontal cells and cones. But in the salamander
				retina these interactions do little to enhance edges. Instead, a robust dynamic interaction
				between amacrine and bipolar cells appears to be responsible for a sharp edge enhancement. To
				demonstrate this we recorded extracellularly from a single ganglion cell and moved a flashed
				square, 300\mu m on a side, over a 1.5\times 1.0 mm2 grid at 25-\mu m increments. Playing back
				all of these recordings simultaneously simulated the pattern of responses that would have been
				measured from an array of ganglion cells. The emerging pattern of ganglion cell activity first
				faithfully represented the flashed square, but after ~60 ms the center of the representation
				collapsed, leaving a representation of only the edges. We inferred that the feedback synapse
				from amacrine to bipolar cells at gamma -aminobutyric acid-C (GABAC) receptors mediated this
				effect: bicuculline and strychnine were ineffective in altering the response pattern, but in
				picrotoxin the center of the representation did not collapse. The GABAergic amacrine cells
				thought to mediate this effect have quite narrow spread of processes, so the existence of this
				edge-enhancing effect suggests a mechanism quite different from classical lateral inhibition,
				namely the delayed inhibition of a spatially expanding input pattern.}

				efficient storage, retrieval, and interpretation continues to be a challenging problem. An
				efficient representation scheme for document images is necessary to solve this problem. Document
				representation involves techniques of thresholding, skew detection, geometric layout analysis,
				and logical layout analysis. The derived representation can then be used in document storage and
				retrieval. Page segmentation is an important stage in representing document images obtained by
				scanning journal pages. The performance of a document understanding system greatly depends on
				the correctness of page segmentation and labeling of different regions such as text, tables,
				images, drawings, and rulers. In this paper, we use the traditional bottom-up approach based on
				the connected component extraction to efficiently implement page segmentation and region
				identification. A new document model which preserves top-down generation information is proposed
				based on which a document is logically represented for interactive editing, storage, retrieval,
				transfer, and logical analysis. Our algorithm has a high accuracy and takes approximately 1.4
				seconds on a SGI Indy workstation for model creation, including orientation estimation,
				segmentation, and labeling (text, table, image, drawing, and ruler) for a 2,550 \times 3,300
				image of a typical journal page scanned at 300 dpi. This method is applicable to documents from
				various technical journals and can accommodate moderate amounts of skew and noise.}

				form for the energy functional related to region-based active contours. We compute the
				associated evolution equation using shape derivation tools and accounting for the evolving
				region-based terms. Then we apply this general framework to compute the evolution equation from
				functionals that include various statistical measures of homogeneity for the region to be
				segmented. Experimental results show that the determinant of the covariance matrix appears to be
				a very relevant tool for segmentation of homogeneous color regions. As an example, it has been
				successfully applied to face segmentation in real video sequences.}

				parasol cells. Electrophysiological studies have indicated that gap junctions do not enlarge the
				receptive field centres of parasol cells, but our results suggest that they make other
				contributions to their light responses. According to our model, the coupled amacrine cells
				enhance the responses of parasol cells to luminance contrast by disinhibition. We also show how
				a mixed chemical and electrical synapse between two sets of amacrine cells presynaptic to the
				parasol cells might make the responses of parasol cells more transient and, therefore, more
				sensitive to motion. Finally, we show how coupling via amacrine cells can synchronize the firing
				of parasol cells. An action potential in a model parasol cell can excite neighbouring parasol
				cells, but only when the coupled amacrine cells also fire action potentials. Passive conduction
				was ineffective due to low-pass temporal filtering. Inhibition from the axons of the coupled
				amacrine cells also produced oscillations that might synchronize the firing of more distant
				ganglion cells.}

				exploiting the information encoded by the correlations themselves. Two very different models,
				one based on axon-mediated inhibitory feedback and the other on oscillatory common input, were
				used to generate artificial spike trains whose synchronous oscillations were similar to those
				measured experimentally. Pooled spike trains were summed into a threshold detector whose output
				was classified using Bayesian discrimination. For a threshold detector with short summation
				times, realistic oscillatory input yielded superior discrimination of stimulus intensity
				compared to rate-matched Poisson controls. Even for summation times too long to resolve
				synchronous inputs, gamma band oscillations still contributed to improved discrimination by
				reducing the total spike count variability, or Fano factor. In separate experiments in which
				neurons were synchronized in a stimulus-dependent manner without attendant oscillations, the
				Fano factor increased markedly with stimulus intensity, implying that stimulus-dependent
				oscillations can offset the increased variability due to synchrony alone.}

				basis functions (AIBF), a new method for the analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging
				(fMRI) data. In contradistinction to existing voxel-based univariate or multivariate methods the
				approach described here can incorporate various forms of prior anatomical knowledge to specify
				sophisticated spatiotemporal models for fMRI time-series. In particular, we focus on anatomical
				prior knowledge, based on reconstructed gray matter surfaces and assumptions about the location
				and spatial smoothness of the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) effect. After
				reconstruction of the grey matter surface from an individual's high-resolution T1-weighted MRI,
				we specify a set of anatomically informed basis functions, fit the model parameters for a single
				time point, using a regularized solution, and finally make inferences about the estimated
				parameters over time. Significant effects, induced by the experimental paradigm, can then be
				visualized in the native voxel-space or on the reconstructed folded, inflated, or flattened
				cortical surface. As an example, we apply the approach to a fMRI study (finger opposition task)
				and compare the results to those of a voxel-based analysis as implemented in the Statistical
				Parametric Mapping package (SPM99). Additionally, we show, using simulated data, that the
				approach offers several desirable features particularly in terms of superresolution and
				localization. }

				photographs and line drawings) when each was compared with its own scrambled-object control. In
				a second experiment we found a reduced response when objects were repeated, independent of
				whether they appeared in the same or a different format (i.e., grayscale images vs line
				drawings). A third experiment showed that activation in the LOC was no stronger for
				threedimensional shapes defined by contours or monocular depth cues, such as occlusion, than for
				two-dimensional shapes, suggesting that these regions are not selectively involved in processing
				three-dimensional shape information. These results suggest that common regions in the LOC are
				involved in extracting and/or representing information about object structure from different

				compensate for neuronal latencies? Alternative accounts propose that it simply shows that moving

				position in the brain. Where is the ‘where’ pathway and how does it work?},

				pre-surgical evaluation period during which intracranial EEG recordings are performed to
				identify the epileptogenic network and provide a functional map of eloquent cerebral areas that
				need to be spared to minimize the risk of post-operative deficits. A growing body of research
				based on such invasive recordings indicates that cortical oscillations at various frequencies,
				especially in the gamma range (40 to 150 Hz), can provide efficient markers of task-related
				neural network activity. Principal Findings: Here we introduce a novel real-time investigation
				framework for mapping human brain functions based on online visualization of the spectral power
				of the ongoing intracranial activity. The results obtained with the first two implanted epilepsy
				patients who used the proposed online system illustrate its feasibility and utility both for
				clinical applications, as a complementary tool to electrical stimulation for presurgical mapping
				purposes, and for basic research, as an exploratory tool used to detect correlations between
				behavior and oscillatory power modulations. Furthermore, our findings suggest a putative role
				for high gamma oscillations in higher-order auditory processing involved in speech and music
				perception. Conclusion/Significance: The proposed real-time setup is a promising tool for
				presurgical mapping, the investigation of functional brain dynamics, and possibly for
				neurofeedback training and brain computer interfaces.},

				we derive a physics-based generalized reflectance map model which includes diffuse and specular
				reflection effects, a nearby point light source and perspective projection, and then we develop
				a new direct shape recovery algorithm from shaded images. The basic idea of our solution method
				is to discretize the image irradiance equation with a finite triangular element surface model,
				to express the resulting nonlinear system of equations in terms of depth variables only and to
				recover the object shape by linearizing the nonlinear equations and minimizing a quadratic cost
				functional. We perform numerical experiments with one or multiple photometric stereo images to
				demonstrate the performance of the derived physics-based reflectance map model and the proposed
				SFS algorithm. }

				from high to low contrast, a neuron rapidly decreases its responsiveness and recovers over 5--20
				s. Cortical adaptation arises from an intrinsic cellular mechanism: a sodium-dependent potassium
				conductance that causes prolonged hyperpolarization. Spiking can drive this mechanism, raising
				the possibility that the same mechanism exists in retinal ganglion cells. We found that
				adaptation in ganglion cells corresponds to a slowly recovering afterhyperpolarization (AHP),
				but, unlike in cortical cells, this AHP is not primarily driven by an intrinsic cellular
				property: spiking was not sufficient to generate adaptation. Adaptation was strongest following
				spatial stimuli tuned to presynaptic bipolar cells rather than the ganglion cell; it was driven
				by a reduced excitatory conductance, and it persisted while blocking GABA and glycine receptors,
				K(Ca) channels, or mGluRs. Thus, slow adaptation arises from reduced glutamate release from
				presynaptic (nonspiking) bipolar cells.}

				Phys. 174(2) (2001) 759]. The key idea is to implicitly represent the target manifold as the
				level-set of a higher dimension al function, and then implement the equations in the Cartesian
				coordinate system where this embedding function is defined. In the case of variational problems,
				we restrict the search of the minimizing map to the class of maps whose target is the level-set
				of interest . In the case of partial differential equations, we re-write all the equation's
				geometric characteristics with respect to the embedding function. We then obtain a set of
				equations that, while defined on the whole Euclidean space, are intrinsic to the implicitly
				defin ed target manifold and map into it. This permits the use of classical numerical technique
				s in Cartesian grids, regardless of the geometry of the target manifold. The extension to open
				surfaces and submanifolds is addressed in this paper as well. In the latter case, the
				submanifold is defined as the intersection of two higher dimensional hypersurfaces, an d all the
				computations are restricted to this intersection. Examples of the applications of the framework
				here described include harmonic maps in liquid crystals, where the target manifold is a
				hypersphere; probability maps, where the target manifold is a hyperplane; chroma enhancement;
				texture mapping; and general geometric mapping between high dimensional manifolds.}

				we examine the specificity of brain regions responsive to a biological motion stimulus without
				local image motion, using functional magnetic resonance imaging. We used the stimulus from
				Beintema and Lappe and compared the brain activity with a point-light display that does contain
				local motion information andwas often used in previous studies.Recent imaging studies have
				identied areas sensitive to biologicalmotion in both the motion-processing and the
				form-processing pathways of the visual system. We find a similar neuronal network engaged in
				biological motion perception, but more strongly manifested in form-processing than in
				motion-processing areas, namely, fusiform-occipital face area and extrastriate body area.}

				does not eliminate the transient tracking direction error nor change the time course of pursuit
				correction. Nonetheless, multiple successive presentations of a single orientation/direction
				condition elicit robust anticipatory pursuit eye movements that always go in the 2D object

				converges only very slowly. It is shown how the convergence can be improved by first calculating
				an asymptotic approximation of the potential and using the so-called addition-subtraction
				method. Since the asymptotic solution is an approximation of the true solution, it gives some
				insight on the dependence of the potential on the conductivities. The formulas are given in
				Cartesian coordinates, so that difficulties with coordinate transformations are avoided.
				Attention is paid to the (fast) computation of the partial derivatives of the potential, which
				is useful for inverse algorithms.}

				correlation to study how humans detect and identify basic image features (bars and short line
				segments). Subjects detected a briefly-flashed 'target bar' that was embedded in 'noise bars'
				that randomly changed in intensity over space and time. By studying how the intensity of the
				noise bars affected performance, we were able to dissociate two processing stages: an early
				'detection' stage, whereby only locations of high contrast energy in the image were selected,
				and an identification stage (~100 ms later) during which subjects used image intensity at
				selected locations to determine whether the target was bright or dark}

				Quantitative Analyses. J. Neurophysiol. 89: 1541-1566, 2003. To facilitate the characterization
				of cortical neuronal function, the responses of cells in cat area 17 to intracellular injection
				of current pulses were quantitatively analyzed. A variety of response variables were used to
				separate the cells into subtypes using cluster analysis. Four main classes of neurons could be
				clearly distinguished: regular spiking (RS), fast spiking (FS), intrinsic bursting (IB), and
				chattering (CH). Each of these contained significant subclasses. RS neurons were characterized
				by trains of action potentials that exhibited spike frequency adaptation. Morphologically, these
				cells were spiny stellate cells in layer 4 and pyramidal cells in layers 2, 3, 5, and 6. FS
				neurons had short-duration action potentials (<0.5 ms at half height), little or no spike
				frequency adaptation, and a steep relationship between injected current intensity and spike
				discharge frequency. Morphologically, these cells were sparsely spiny or aspiny nonpyramidal
				cells. IB neurons typically generated a low frequency (<425 Hz) burst of spikes at the beginning
				of a depolarizing current pulse followed by a tonic train of action potentials for the remainder
				of the pulse. These cells were observed in all cortical layers, but were most abundant in layer
				5. Finally, CH neurons generated repetitive, high-frequency (350-700 Hz) bursts of
				short-duration (<0.55 ms) action potentials. Morphologically, these cells were layer 2-4 (mainly
				layer 3) pyramidal or spiny stellate neurons. These results indicate that firing properties do
				not form a continuum and that cortical neurons are members of distinct electrophysiological
				classes and subclasses.}

				selectively to the direction and speed of moving stimuli. Beyond simple cells, most studies of
				direction selectivity have focused on either V1 complex cells or neurons in the middle temporal
				area (MT/V5). To understand how visual information is transferred along this pathway, we have
				studied all three types of neurons, using a reverse correlation procedure to obtain high spatial
				and temporal resolution maps of activity for different motion stimuli. Most complex and MT cells
				showed strong second-order interactions, indicating that they were tuned for particular
				displacements of an apparent motion stimulus. The spatiotemporal structure of these interactions
				showed a high degree of similarity between the populations of V1 complex cells andMTcells, in
				terms of the spatiotemporal limits and preferences for motion and their two-dimensional spatial
				structure. Much of the structure in the V1 andMTsecond-order kernels could be accounted for on
				the basis of the first-order responses of V1 simple cells, under the assumption of a Reichardt
				or motion-energy type of computation.}

				approach relies on the propagation of smooth interfaces to perform tracking while using an
				incremental estimation of the motion models. Implicit representations are used to represent
				moving objects, and capture their motion parameters. Information from different sources like a
				boundary attraction term, a background subtraction component and a visual consistency constraint
				are considered. The EulerLagrange equations within a gradient descent method lead to a flow that
				deforms a set of initial curve towards the object boundaries as well an incremental robust
				estimator of their apparent motion. Partial extension of the proposed framework to address dense
				motion estimation and the case of moving observer is also presented. Promising results
				demonstrate the performance of the method.},

				deformations field, incrementally recovered. In order to demonstrate the performance of the
				selected representation a simple criterion is considered, the sum of square differences.
				Empirical validation and promising results were obtained on examples that exhibit large global

				of what we see or of having seen at all is a problem that has eluded neuroscience. Recordings
				from macaque V1 during deactivation of MT1/V5 and psychophysical studies of perceptual
				integration suggest that feedback from secondary visual areas to V1 is necessary for visual
				awareness. We used transcranial magnetic stimulation to probe the timing and function of
				feedback from human area MT1/V5 to V1 and found its action to be early and critical for
				awareness of visual motion.}

				important fluctuations of the membrane potential (V(m)). We review here different methods to
				characterize this activity and its impact on spike generation. The simplified, fluctuating
				point-conductance model of synaptic activity provides the starting point of a variety of methods
				for the analysis of intracellular V(m) recordings. In this model, the synaptic excitatory and
				inhibitory conductances are described by Gaussian-distributed stochastic variables, or "colored
				conductance noise". The matching of experimentally recorded V(m) distributions to an invertible
				theoretical expression derived from the model allows the extraction of parameters characterizing
				the synaptic conductance distributions. This analysis can be complemented by the matching of
				experimental V(m) power spectral densities (PSDs) to a theoretical template, even though the
				unexpected scaling properties of experimental PSDs limit the precision of this latter approach.
				Building on this stochastic characterization of synaptic activity, we also propose methods to
				qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate spike-triggered averages of synaptic time-courses
				preceding spikes. This analysis points to an essential role for synaptic conductance variance in
				determining spike times. The presented methods are evaluated using controlled conductance
				injection in cortical neurons in vitro with the dynamic-clamp technique. We review their
				applications to the analysis of in vivo intracellular recordings in cat association cortex,
				which suggest a predominant role for inhibition in determining both sub- and supra-threshold
				dynamics of cortical neurons embedded in active networks.},

				coronal plasma structures frozen by the magnetic field. As optically thin coronal emission lines
				introduce uncertainties on the reconstructions, it is needed to develop constraints on
				stereoscopic methods to be able to use them in the solar case. Basic geometric assumptions on
				structures made possible to determine the main parameters on loops - including their twists -,
				arcade loops structures or filament shapes, using the difference angle due to solar rotation
				with SOHO/EIT. Tomographic techniques are being adapted to coronagraphic data such as
				SOHO/LASCO. 3D analysis of flare formation on April 7th, 1997 shows emerging flux near a sigmoid
				loop with magnetic fields reconnection. October 13th, 1999 a twisted filament becomes instable
				and creates a limb CME. April 6-7th, 1998 at the limb, several ejections of twisted structures
				are observed. In all of these cases, the role of the helicity in these instabilities formations
				is analyzed. Consequences of the observed detwisting processes in ejections of material into the
				interplanetary space up to aurora formations are described. Then improvements expected in
				dynamical cases due to simultaneous observations at various angle, provided by the STEREO
				mission (launched in December 2004) are presented in the context of the space weather
				forecast.},

				suggests the presence of a vertical stack of neural strata at the inner plexiform layer (IPL).
				Conversely, many inhibitory amacrine cell classes are multiply or diffusely stratified,
				indicating that they might convey information between strata. On the basis of the diverse
				stratification and physiological properties of ganglion cells, it was suggested that the IPL
				contains a parallel set of representations of the visual world embodied in the strata and
				conveyed to higher centres by the classes of ganglion cells whose dendrites ramify at that
				stratum. Here we show that each stratum receives unique and substantively different excitatory
				and inhibitory neural inputs that are integrated to form at least ten different, parallel
				space-time spiking outputs. The response properties of these strata are ordered in the time
				domain. Inhibition through GABAC receptors extracts spatial edges in neural representations and
				seems to separate the functional properties of the strata. We describe a new form of neuronal
				interaction that we call 'vertical inhibition' that acts not laterally, but between strata.}

				parameters. In this paper we consider projective reconstructions from pairs of views, and
				compare a number of the available methods. Projective stereo algorithms can be categorized by
				the way in which the 3D coordinates are computed. The first class is similar to traditional
				stereo algorithms in that the 3D world geometry is made explicit; the initial phase of the
				processing always involves the estimation of the camera matrices from which the 3D coordinates
				are computed. We show how the camera matrices can be computed either from point correspondences,
				or how they are constrained by the fundamental matrices. The second class of algorithms are
				based on implicit image measurements which are used to compute projective invariants from image
				correspondences. The invariants are based on the Cayley algebra and on cross ratios. In all
				cases, the invariants are functionally dependent on the 3D coordinates. We report on the
				stabilities of the different methods using a range of meaningful synthetic and real images. From
				these we can conclude which methods are most likely to be of use in applications that are
				dependent on 3D uncalibrated reconstructions. }

				approach is proposed for the separation of the superimposed layers. Focusing on either of the
				layers yields initial separation, but crosstalk remains. The separation is enhanced by mutual
				blurring of the perturbing components in the images. However, this blurring requires the
				estimation of the defocus blur kernels. We thus propose a method for self calibration of the
				blur kernels, given the raw images. The kernels are sought to minimize the mutual information of
				the recovered layers. Autofocusing and depth estimation in the presence of semi-reflections are
				also considered. Experimental results are presented. }

				contains relatively few color-opponent neurons. Neuroimaging measurements, however, have
				suggested that such neurons might be relatively numerous. Here, we reconcile these apparently
				discrepant results and conclude that V1 contains relatively large numbers of color-opponent
				neurons. We first review results from each method and find that most neuroimaging studies
				provide evidence of substantial color opponency in V1, and that despite apparent controversy,
				most single-unit studies agree that relatively large numbers of V1 neurons show some sort of
				color opponency. To reconcile the results from different techniques more formally, we used
				electrophysiological data to predict the outcomes of neuroimaging experiments. We simulated the
				expected fMRI response in V1 to spatial patterns of different color, based on the neurons'
				properties, as reported in Johnson, Hawken, and Shapley, (2001). The simulated responses to
				stimuli used in Engel, Zhang, and Wandell, (1997) agree well with the actually observed fMRI
				results. The model identifies several factors that led to the apparent discrepancy between
				techniques, and makes testable predictions about how these factors influence the magnitude of
				color-opponent signals. fMRI and single-unit data converge to show that large numbers of
				color-opponent neurons exist in V1.}

				conservation of two five point projective invariants (groups for which this invariant is
				conserved are assumed to be coplanar). The correspondences for four of the five points are used
				to define a projectivity which is used to predict the change in position of other points
				assuming they lie on the same plane as the original four. A distance threshold between actual
				and predicted position is used to find extended planar regions. If two distinct planar regions
				can be found then a novel motion direction estimator suggests itself.}

				to short stimuli to predict responses to longer stimuli. The second test consisted of fitting
				ideal impulse response functions to the observed responses for each event duration. Both methods
				show that the extent of the nonlinearity varies across cortices. Results for the second method
				indicate that the hemodynamic response is nonlinear for stimuli less than 10 s in the primary
				auditory cortex, nonlinear for tasks less than 7 s in the primary motor cortex, and nonlinear
				for stimuli less than 3 s in the primary visual cortex. In addition, neural adaptation functions
				were characterized that could model the observed nonlinearities.}

				methods -like PCA, ICA, clustering- have been developed to give an account of the dataset with
				minimal priors: No assumption is made on the data content itself, but the data structure is
				assumed to show some properties (decorrelation, independence) that allow for the detection of
				structures of interest. In this paper, we present an alternative that tries to take into account
				some relevant knowledge for the analysis of the dataset, e.g. the experimental paradigm, while
				keeping the flexibility of exploratory methods: FIR model for the hemodynamic response, presence
				of autocorrelated signals. Our analysis of the data is thus particularly concentrated on the
				temporal aspects. The danger, related to the short length of the time series, is the risk of
				over-fitting the data. In our setting, the flexibility of the model is tempered by a Minimum
				Description Length approach. The construction of a global model is performed with the help of a
				kernel PCA method, that builds a \textit{redundant} representation of the data through the
				nonlinearity of the kernel. This allows for a refinement in the description of the (temporal)
				patterns of interest. In particular, this helps for the characterization of subtle variations in
				the response to different experimental conditions. This improvement is shown on two examples
				taken from real data. }

				source at infinity or a uniform hemispheric source. It will be convenient and useful if we can
				perform SFS under indoor lights that may be spherical, cylindrical, or flat (ceiling lights) in
				shape in an uncontrolled environment. As a first step toward this goal we propose a light source
				model for each of the above shapes for performing SFS. In this study we give the derivation of
				the rectangular, spherical, and cylindrical light source models. In indoor environments the
				positions (usually on the ceiling or walls) of the light sources are known. Assuming that the
				target object is small relative to the distances from the sources, we have derived a reflectance
				map for the Lambertian surface of an object under a mixture of light sources of the above
				shapes. Hence the shape recovery can be performed by using the SFS technique. This is a
				significant step toward the application of SFS in uncontrolled practical environments under
				household or office lighting. This technique of shape recovery is verified by many examples of
				simulations and real experiments, and the results are good. }

				integrate-and-fire model is physiologically relevant in that its parameters can be easily
				related to physiological quantities. The interaction of the differential equations with the
				reset results in a rich and complex dynamical structure. We relate the subthreshold features of
				the model to the dynamical properties of the differential system and the spike patterns to the
				properties of a Poincar'e map defined by the sequence of spikes. We find a complex bifurcation
				structure which has a direct interpretation in terms of spike trains. For some parameter values,

				the Mumford-Shah (1989) paradigm from a curve evolution perspective. In particular, we let a set
				of deformable contours define the boundaries between regions in an image where we model the data
				via piecewise smooth functions and employ a gradient flow to evolve these contours. Each
				gradient step involves solving an optimal estimation problem for the data within each region,
				connecting curve evolution and the Mumford-Shah functional with the theory of boundary-value
				stochastic processes. The resulting active contour model offers a tractable implementation of
				the original Mumford-Shah model (i.e., without resorting to elliptic approximations which have
				traditionally been favored for greater ease in implementation) to simultaneously segment and
				smoothly reconstruct the data within a given image in a coupled manner. Various implementations
				of this algorithm are introduced to increase its speed of convergence. We also outline a
				hierarchical implementation of this algorithm to handle important image features such as triple
				points and other multiple junctions. Next, by generalizing the data fidelity term of the
				original Mumford-Shah functional to incorporate a spatially varying penalty, we extend our
				method to problems in which data quality varies across the image and to images in which sets of
				pixel measurements are missing. This more general model leads us to a novel PDE-based approach
				for simultaneous image magnification, segmentation, and smoothing, thereby extending the
				traditional applications of the Mumford-Shah functional which only considers simultaneous
				segmentation and smoothing }

				significantly activated in 23/25 subjects tested in the subtraction of uniform motion from
				kinetic gratings. The KO region is genuinely specialized for processing kinetic boundaries since
				it is significantly more activated by kinetic gratings than by luminance-defined gratings,
				uniform motion or transparent motion. This leaves only the kinetic boundaries, created by
				discontinuities in motion direction, as the specific stimulus aspect, activating the KO region.
				The KO region is anatomically and functionally distinct from areas MT/V5, V3 and V3A. It also
				has minimal overlap with the lateral occipital (LO) region. The selective activation of the KO
				region is robust and relatively immune to changes in stimulus size, spatial frequency and type
				of kinetic boundary. These results strongly argue for the view that the KO region is a new,
				separate, functional region in human occipital cortex. }

				the possibility of unambiguously localizing functional imaging data with respect to the
				functional architecture of the visual system, it is a powerful tool for the investigation of
				retinotopic properties of visual areas in the healthy and impaired brain. fMRI retinotopic
				mapping differs conceptually from a more traditional volume-based, block-type, or event-related
				analysis, in terms of both the surface-based analysis of the data and the phaseencoded paradigm.
				Several methodological works related to fMRI retinotopic mapping have been published. However, a
				detailed description of all the methods involved, discussing the steps from stimulus design to
				the processing of phase data on the surface, is still missing. We describe here step by step our
				methodology for the complete processing chain. Besides reusing methods proposed by other
				researchers in the field, we introduce original ones: improved stimuli for the mapping of polar
				angle retinotopy, a method of assigning volume-based functional data to the surface, and a way
				of weighting phase information optimally to account for the SNR obtained locally. To assess the
				robustness of these methods we present a study performed on three subjects, demonstrating the
				reproducibility of the delineation of low order visual areas.}

				implementation constraints. The underlying model includes a linear model of filtering in the
				Outer Plexiform Layer, a shunting feedback at the level of bipolar cells accounting for rapid
				contrast gain control, and a spike generation process modeling ganglion cells. We prove the
				pertinence of our software by reproducing several experimental measurements from single ganglion
				cells such as cat X and Y cells. This software will be an evolutionary tool for neuroscientists
				that need realistic large-scale input spike trains in subsequent treatments, and for educational

				in the brain, can provide multidimensional movement control of a robotic arm or a
				neuroprosthesis. We now show that a noninvasive BCI that uses scalp-recorded
				electroencephalographic activity and an adaptive algorithm can provide humans, including people
				with spinal cord injuries, with multidimensional point-to-point movement control that falls
				within the range of that reported with invasive methods in monkeys. In movement time, precision,
				and accuracy, the results are comparable to those with invasive BCIs. The adaptive algorithm
				used in this noninvasive BCI identifies and focuses on the electroencephalographic features that
				the person is best able to control and encourages further improvement in that control. The
				results suggest that people with severe motor disabilities could use brain signals to operate a
				robotic arm or a neuroprosthesis without needing to have electrodes implanted in their brains.},

				technique tries to make the best use of the rigidity of the geometry between two cameras. The
				idea is to first estimate precisely the epipolar geometry which is valid for a wide range in
				space from all available matches, extracted from both the environment and the calibration
				objects. This allows us to conduct an accurate projective reconstruction. Using the \emph{a
				priori} knowledge of the calibration object, we are finally able to calibrate the stereo rig in
				a Euclidean space. The proposed technique has been tested with a number of real images, and
				significant improvement has been observed. Keywords: camera calibration, stereo vision, on-line

				the fundamental difficulties in recognising objects from images: that the appearance of an
				object depends on viewpoint. This problem is entirely avoided if the geometric description is
				unaffected by the imaging transformation. Such invariant descriptions can be measured from
				images without without any prior knowledge of the position, orientation and calibration of the
				camera. These invariant measures can be used to index a library of object models for recognition
				and provide a principled basis for the other stages of the recognition process such as feature
				groping and hypothesis verification. Object models can be acquired directly from images,
				allowing efficient construction of model libraries without manual intervention. A significant
				part of the paper is a summary of recent results on the construction of invariants for 3D
				objects from a single perspective view. A proposed recognition architecture is described which
				enables the integration of multiple general object classes and provides a means for enforcing
				global scene consistency. Various criticisms of the invariant approach are articulated and
				addressed.}

				can be upgraded to Euclidean structure by identifying two entities, the plane at in,nity and the
				absolute conic. Auto-calibration methods use constraints induced by the rigid motion of the
				camera to determine the Euclidean structure (or equivalently the camera calibration). Often
				these motion constraints are supplemented by known values of the camera internal parameters or
				scene constraints in order to resolve ambiguities or stabilize the algorithms. It is shown in
				this paper that in certain common situations this supplementary information may not resolve the
				ambiguity. This is illustrated for the particular ambiguity arising for motions with a single
				direction of the rotation axis. Four types of constraint are analyzed, and the conditions under
				which the ambiguity is not resolved are given. The constraint cases are: perpendicular image
				axes (the zero-skew constraint); speci,ed image aspect ratio; speci,ed image principal point;
				and, perpendicularity of scene features. }

				This book has appeared in Russian translation and has been praised both for its lively
				exposition and its fundamental contributions. The author first develops a general theory of
				nonsmooth analysis and geometry which, together with a set of associated techniques, has had a
				profound effect on several branches of analysis and optimization. Clarke then applies these
				methods to obtain a powerful, unified approach to the analysis of problems in optimal control
				and mathematical programming. Examples are drawn from economics, engineering, mathematical
				physics, and various branches of analysis in this reprint volume.}

				the analysis of visual cues to motion, color, texture, and depth. The contributions are linked
				thematically by a consistent consideration of the links between empirical data and computational
				models in the study of visual function. An introductory chapter by Edward Adelson and James
				Bergen gives a new and elegant formalization of the elements of early vision. Subsequent
				sections treat receptors and sampling, models of neural function, detection and discrimination,
				color and shading, motion and texture, and 3D shape. Each section is introduced by a brief

				controlling our actions. The visual motion system has evolved as an exquisite machinery adapted
				to reconstruct the direction and speed of the object of interest within a few dozen
				milliseconds. In the last decade, tremendous progress has been made in the understanding of how
				the outputs of local motion detectors are integrated. In particular, its dynamics are now
				unveiled at neuronal and behavioral levels. Solutions for fundamental computational problems
				such as the aperture problem and the interplay between motion segmentation and integration have
				been proposed from these works and biologically-realistic simulations are been proposed. Such a
				multi-level approach is rooted in the fact that dynamics of these solutions can be tackled at
				different scales using similar tasks and stimuli. Dynamics of Visual Motion Processing offers an
				overview of recent work on the dynamics of motion integration with inter-related examples taken
				from physiology (both single-neuron and population activity) and psychophysics as well as
				sensorimotor control or active vision. The last section presents three different approaches for
				understanding and modeling motion perception of natural scenes, complex 3D layout, and
				biological motion.},

				navigation problems in mobile robots. In invariant indexing one computes measures from a scene
				that index into a model base with minimal search, so producing hypotheses of the identities of
				objects present in the scene. This book investigates how these measures are incorporated into a
				recognition system and also develops a range of projective indexes that can be used. The benefit
				of using projective measures is that they are unchanged by the imaging process. }

				scientists and graduate students will have a complete set of methods, algorithms, and

				autocalibration of visual sensors on robotic heads and mobile robots. Analogies with biological
				visual systems provide an easy introduction to this subject.}

				methodology for benchmarking. Here, we propose an evaluation methodology for motion estimation
				which is based on human visual performance, as measured in psychophysics and neurobiology.
				Offering proper evaluation methodology is essential to continue progress in modeling. This
				general idea has been very well understood and applied in computer vision where challenging
				benchmarks are now available, allowing models to be compared and further improved. The proposed
				standardized tools allow to compare different approaches, and to challenge current models of
				motion processing in order to define current failures in our comprehension of visual cortical
				function. We built a database of image sequences to depict input test cases corresponding to
				displays used in psychophysical settings or in physiological experiments. The data sets are
				fully annotated in terms of image and stimulus size and ground truth data concerning dynamics,
				direction, speed, etc. Since different kinds of models have different kinds of representation
				and granularity, we had to define generic outputs for each considered experiment as well as
				correctness evaluation tools. We propose to use output data generated by the considered model as
				read out that relates to observer task or functional behavior. Amplitude of pursuit or direction
				likelihoods are two examples. We probed several models of motion perception by utilizing the
				proposed benchmark The employed models show very different properties and internal mechanisms,
				such as feedforward normalizing models of V1 and MT processing and recurrent feedback models.
				Our results demonstrate the usefulness of the approach by highlighting current properties and
				failures in processing. So we provide here a valuable tool to unravel the fundamental mechanisms
				of the visual cortex in motion perception. The complete database as well as detailed scoring
				instructions and results derived by investigating several models are available at

				modulated by luminance information. This model incorporates feedforward, feedback and inhibitive
				lateral connections and is inspired by the neural architecture and dynamics of motion processing
				cortical areas in the primate (V1, V2, and MT). The first aspect of our contribution is to
				propose a new anisotropic integration model where motion diffusion through recurrent
				connectivity between cortical areas working at different spatial scales is gated by the
				luminance distribution in the image. This simple model offers a competitive alternative to less
				parsimonious models based on a large set of cortical layers implementing specific form or motion
				features detectors. A second aspect that is often ignored by many 2D motion integration models
				is that biological computation of global motion is highly dynamical. When presented with simple
				lines, plaids or barberpoles stimuli, the perceived direction reported by human observers, as
				well as the response of motion sensitive neurons, will shift over time. We demonstrate that the
				proposed approach produces results compatible with several psychophysical experiments concerning
				not only the resulting global motion perception, but also concerning the oculomotor dynamics Our
				model can also explain several properties of MT neurons regarding the dynamics of selective
				motion integration, a fundamental property of object motion disambiguation and segmentation. As
				a whole, we present an improved motion integration model, which is numerically tractable and
				reproduces key aspect of cortical motion integration in primate.},

				existing reading aid systems, dealing with printed and electronic documents. Then, we show how
				Navisio al- lows to extend the capabilities of existing reading systems, focusing on the
				facilitation to navigate in complex documents, and on the highly customizable display. Navisio
				performance was evaluated against a stan- dard CCTV magni er tool, with 26 low vision patients.
				Two kinds of texts were proposed (simple and complex documents) elaborated from a standardised
				text database. Results show a clear advantage of Navisio in terms of reading speed and comfort.
				Navisio is intended to evolve: we discuss how it could be extended to any scanned document,
				thanks to recent computer vision approaches in document layout analysis. Further challenging
				perspectives are also mentioned.},

				Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA 99 5661 - 5663) seems to challenge
				this classical view. Subjects can perceive reliably the direction of walking from a new type of
				point-light stimulus (sequential position stimulus, SPS) with strongly impoverished local-motion
				information. This stimulus was generated by randomising the dot positions on the skeleton of the
				walker. This suggests that form, rather than local motion information, is critical for th
				perception of point-light stimuli. We present experimental and computational evidence that
				suggests a different interpretation of this experiment: (i) We show that there is substantial
				residual motion information in the SPS, which is sufficient for a reliable detection of walking
				direction. We also show that a recognition performance close to psychophysical results can be
				achieved by extracting this information with simple physiologically plausible neural detectors.
				(ii) We present a new type of point-light stimulus (critical feature stimulus, CFS) that matches
				closely the low-level properties of the SPS, but which is incompatible with the kinematics of a
				human body. In spite of this fact, recognition performance is comparable to the SPS. This result
				seems to contradict recognition of point-light walkers by reconstruction of body shape from the
				dot positions. A physiologically plausible account for both experimental results is provided by
				the hypothesis that point-light stimuli are recognised by detection of specific spatial
				arrangements of opponent-motion features.}

				tissues, in particular the skull, in order to improve the head models used in
				Electroencephalography (EEG). In the quasistatic approximation, the problem can be modeled by a
				Poisson equation with a non-vanishing Neumann boundary condition. We introduce a symmetric
				boundary integral formulation, which is discretized using mixed finite elements, and show its

				ideas to the spatio-temporal case. For this purpose, we show that the direct 3D counterparts to
				commonly used 2D interest point detectors are inadequate, and we propose an alternative.
				Anchoring off of these interest points, we devise a recognition algorithm based on
				spatio-temporally windowed data. We present recognition results on a variety of datasets

				well-controlled statistical properties, subjects were eye-tracked during the observation of such
				scenes. Detection rates, fixation rates and times were assessed from 12 naive subjects and a few
				expert observers. The results were compared with two theoretical models: (1) an approach for
				saliency computation based on low-level features (Bruce and Tsotsos, 2009), and (2) a graphical
				Bayesian model that was trained with expert knowledge derived from scenes containing
				security-relevant events, exploiting optic flow features extracted with a neurally plausible
				algorithm (Beck et al, 2007). We characterize the relative importance of salience and expert
				knowledge for the generation of correct detections and the visual search strategies for both
				types of observers. We found substantial differences betwen the observer types, suggesting a
				specific knowledge-driven search strategy for the expert observers.},

				a sequence of images without any prior knowledge either about the parameters of the cameras, or
				about the motion of the camera(s). We do not require any knowledge of the absolute coordinates
				of some control points in the scene to achieve this goal. Using various computer vision tools,
				we establish correspondences between images and recover the epipolar geometry of the set of
				images, from which we show how to compute the complete set of perspective projection matrices
				for each camera position. These being known, we proceed to reconstruct the scene. This
				reconstruction is defined up to an unknown projective transformation (i.e. is parameterized with
				15 arbitrary parameters). Next we show how to go from this reconstruction to a more constrained
				class of reconstructions, defined up to an unknown affine transformation (i.e. parameterized
				with 12 arbitrary parameters) by exploiting known geometric relations between features in the
				scene such as parallelism. Finally, we show how to go from this reconstruction to another class,
				defined up to an unknown similitude (i.e. parameterized with 7 arbitrary parameters). This means
				that in an Euclidean frame attached to the scene or to one of the cameras, the reconstruction
				depends only upon one parameter, the global scale. This parameter is easily fixed as soon as one
				absolute length measurement is known. We see this vision system as a building block, a vision
				server, of a CAD system that is used by a human to model a scene for such applications as
				simulation, virtual or augmented reality. We believe that such a system can save a lot of
				tedious work to the human observer as well as play a leading role in keeping the geometric data
				base accurate and coherent}

				adjustable resolution. The algorithm relies on an adaptation of the K-means clustering in a non
				convex domain with geodesic distances. Fine anatomical or functional constraints can be embedded
				through the use of weighted geodesic distances. The applications of such a method are
				principally connectivity studies, multivariate analyses and fusion with other modalities.}

				feature, such as a road, a building, a river or the underlying terrain, is extracted from one or
				more images by adjusting the model's state variables until a minimum value of the objective
				function is obtained. The optimization procedure yields a description that simultaneously
				satisfies (or nearly satisfies) all constraints, and, as a result, is likely to be a good model
				of the feature. <p> Furthermore, because objects are all modeled in the same fashion, we can
				refine the models simultaneously and enforce geometric and semantic constraints between objects,
				thus increasing not only the accuracy but also the consistency of the reconstruction. <p> We
				believe that these capabilities will prove indispensable to automating the generation of complex
				object databases from imagery, such as the ones required for realistic simulations or
				intelligence analysis.}

				the relative directions of the right-angled intersections. Some authors (Wolfe, 1984 Perception
				13 33 - 40; for a review see Ninio and Stevens, 2000 Perception 29 1209 - 1217) show that the
				magnitude -- not the existence -- of the illusion depends on certain geometrical properties. We
				made some simple distortions to the Hermann grid that make the illusion disappear totally while
				the Hermann-grid character remains. The most effective of these was to replace the straight
				lines with sine curves leaving the intersections right-angled. The illusion is found to
				disappear at a surprisingly small sine amplitude (amplitude/period < 1/10). We supported these
				results with psychophysical measurements (n = 29). Simple geometrical consideration shows that
				the distortions produced here do not change the weighted sum of the receptive field. We conclude
				that the Baumgartner model is not an adequate explanation of the Hermann grid illusion, because
				its prediction is contrary to the observations. The same distortions applied to the
				scintillating grid made the scintillations disappear. }

				(HP) basis constrained to the sphere. All three bases span the same vector space and are
				bijective when the rank of the SH series equals the order of the ST and equals the degree of the
				HP. We show, therefore, how it is possible to extract the maxima and minima of an ASSF by
				computing the stationary points of a constrained HP. In Diffusion MRI, the Orientation
				Distribution Function (ODF), represents a state of the art reconstruction method whose maxima
				are aligned with the dominant fiber bundles. It is, therefore, important to be able to correctly
				estimate these maxima to detect the fiber directions. The ODF is an ASSF. To illustrate the
				potential of our method, we take up the example of the ODF, and extract its maxima to detect the
				fiber directions. Thanks to our method we are able to extract the maxima without limiting our
				search to a discrete set of values on the sphere, but by searching the maxima of a continuous
				function. Our method is also general, not dependent on the ODF, and the framework we present can
				be applied to any ASSF described in one of the three bases.},

				and the usage of MEG source imaging for innovative retinotopic explorations. In this context, we
				compare two imaging models of MEG generators in realistic simulations of activations within the
				visual cortex. Localization and spatial extent of neural activity in the visual cortex were
				extracted from retinotopic maps obtained in fMRI. We prove that the suggested approaches are
				robust and succeed in accurately recovering the activation patterns with satisfactory match with
				fMRI results. These results suggest that fast retinotopic exploration of the visual cortex could
				be obtained from MEG as a complementary alternative to more standard fMRI approaches. The
				excellent time resolution of MEG imaging further opens interesting perspectives on the temporal

				cast the segmentation problem as themaximization of the mutual information between the region
				labels and the image pixel intensities, subject to a constraint on the total length of the
				region boundaries. We assume that the probability densities associated with the image pixel
				intensities within each region are completely unknown a priori, and we formulate the problem
				based on nonparametric density estimates. Due to the nonparametric structure, our method does
				not require the image regions to have a particular type of probability distribution, and does
				not require the extraction and use of a particular statistic. We solve the information-theoretic
				optimization problem by deriving the associated gradient flows and applying curve evolution
				techniques. We use fast level set methods to implement the resulting evolution. The evolution
				equations are based on nonparametric statistics, and have anintuitive appeal. The experimental
				results based on both synthetic and real images demonstrate that the proposed technique can
				solve a variety of challenging image segmentation problems. }

				methods are nowadays reaching a very impressive level of quality. However all these modern
				techniques share a very lengthy computational time that completely forbids their more widespread
				use in practical setups: the typical running time of such algorithms range from one to several
				hours. One possible solution to this problem seems to lie in the use of graphics hardware: more
				and more computer vision techniques are taking advantage of the availability of cheap
				computational horsepower and divert graphics hardware from its original purpose to accelerate
				the early stages of some algorithms. We present here an almost full implementation on graphics

				recent well known multiscale techniques. We demonstrate how this approach offers a good

				regularization technique for data defined on triangulated surfaces: the Beltrami flow over
				intrinsic manifolds. This technique overcomes the over - smoothing of the L2 and the
				stair-casing effects of the L1 flow for strongly noised images. To do so, we locally estimate
				the differential operators and then perform temporal finite differences. We present the
				implementation for scalar images defined in 2 dimensional manifolds and experimental results.},

				digital library organization, etc. However, it remains a challenging task for computers to
				achieve robust action recognition due to cluttered background, camera motion, occlusion, and
				geometric and photometric variances of objects. We present a novel unsupervised learning method
				for learning human action categories. A video sequence is represented as a collection of
				spatial-temporal words by extracting space-time interest points. The algorithm learns the
				probability distributions of the spatial-temporal words and intermediate topics corresponding to
				human action categories automatically using a probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (pLSA)
				model. The learned model is then used for human action categorization and localization in a
				novel video, by maximizing the posterior of action category (topic) distributions. The
				contributions of this work are as follows: * Unsupervised learning of actions using 'video
				words' representation: We deploy a pLSA model with 'bag of video words' representation for video
				analysis; * Multiple action localization and categorization: Our approach is not only able to
				classify different actions, but also to localize different actions simultaneously in a novel and
				complex video sequence.}

				time-varying natural images with maximum sparsity. The basis functions are considered as part of
				a probabilistic model of image sequences, with a sparse prior imposed over the coefficients.
				Learning is accomplished by maximizing the log-likelihood of the model, using natural movies as
				training data. The basis functions that emerge are space-time inseparable functions that
				resemble the motion-selective receptive fields of simple-cells in mammalian visual cortex. When
				the coefficients are computed via matching-pursuit in space and time, one obtains a punctate,
				spike-like representation of continuous time-varying images. It is suggested that such a coding
				scheme may be at work in the visual cortex.}

				edgel chains and junctions, cannot be extracted reliably from image intensity data. In this
				paper we demonstrate that this view is overly pessimistic and that visual tasks, such as
				perceptual grouping, can be carried out much more efficiently and reliably if well-formed
				topological structures are available. Towards this end, we describe an edge detection algorithm
				designed to recover much better scene topology than previously considered possible. In doing
				this we need make no sacrifice to geometric accuracy of the edge description. }

				that for several common types of camera motion, self-calibration is degenerate, which manifests
				itself through the existence of ambiguous solutions. In a previous paper, we have studied these
				critical motion sequences in detail and have revealed their importance for practical
				applications. In this paper, we reveal a type of camera motion that is not critical for the
				generic self-calibration problem, but for which the Kruppa equation approach fails. This is the
				case if all optical centers lie on a sphere and if the optical axes pass through the sphere's
				center. This situation is very natural for 3D object modeling from photographs or image
				sequences. Our result is thus a contribution to the understanding of how to successfully apply
				self-calibration in practice. }

				contrast has become a common tool for the localization of brain processes associated with all
				kinds of psychological tasks. fMRI data analysis has first been performed from a hypothesis
				testing point of view, in which the experimenter tests the presence of a predicted effect in the
				data. The success of this approach is largely due to the relatively intuitive and efficient
				methods (general linear model) proposed to analyze the data \cite{friston-holmes-etal:95}.
				Nevertheless, the power of this kind of methods is related to the validity of the underlying
				hypotheses, so that there is also a need for less constrained methods that give an account of
				the data prior to hypothesis testing : this is what exploratory analysis deals with (see
				\cite{friman-borga-etal:02}, for example). To date, the most popular exploratory technique for
				fMRI data is probably spatial independent components analysis (ICA), which tries to untangle the
				data into spatially independent components \cite{mckeown-makeig-etal:98}. What is not
				satisfactory is that these methods ignore the temporal content of the data, which actually
				allows for the interpretation of the components in terms of task-related activity. In fact, if
				activation signals are weak, it is not certain that any ICA algorithm can really uncover them
				(especially after a PCA data reduction). The solution to that problem is to model the temporal
				content of the data together with the spatial unmixing. In our work, we reformulate the
				multivariate analysis problem by introducing an evolution model coupled with a mixing model.
				Formally, Let $Y$ be a fMRI dataset, where each $Y(t)$ is an image which is simply written as a
				$N$-dimensional vector. $N$ is thus the number of voxels considered in the analysis, and the
				length of the series is $T$. We introduce a $K$-dimensional state variable $X(t)$, which in
				effect describes the state of the system at each time. Here $0<K<min(N,T)$. The experimental
				paradigm will be a $C \times T$ matrix $P$, where $C$ is the number of experimental conditions.
				Each row of $P$ is the time course of an experimental condition. We assume that there is a
				function $\Phi$ from $\mathbb{R}^{K+C}$ to $\mathbb{R}^K$ that explains the evolution of the
				system. The state-space model is thus defined by the equations: \begin{eqnarray} X(t+1) \&amt; =
				\&amt; \Phi(X(t),P(t)) +V(t) \label{evolution} \\ Y(t) \&amt; = \&amt; M.X(t) +W(t)
				\label{mixing} \end{eqnarray} where the $N$-dimensional vector $W(t)$ and the $K-$dimensional
				vector $V(t)$ are noise terms. The matrix $M$ is the well known (spatial) mixing matrix.
				Equation (\ref{evolution}) is the evolution equation while equation (\ref{mixing}) is the mixing
				equation. The analysis of fMRI data becomes an estimation problem: given the data $Y$ and the
				experimental paradigm $P$, one has to estimate $X$, the state variable, the evolution model
				$\Phi$, and the mixing matrix $M$. This model should give a complete account of the dynamics of
				the original dataset $Y$. Following the approach of Soatto and Chiuso in the context of the
				study of dynamical textures \cite{soatto-chiuso:01}, we propose a second-order solution, valid
				under a gaussian noise hypothesis, assuming the linearity of $\Phi$. We also propose a solution
				for the estimation of $K$, and show how to improve the estimation by introducing higher order
				evolution models. Our method is tested on synthetic as well as real datasets. A concern of
				interest being the estimation of $K$, the dimension of the state variable, we show that our
				method is reliable and stable with respect to small variations of the input data. The method
				does not only provide the main activation patterns, but also autoregressive {\em confounds},
				which are strongly autocorrelated patterns present of the data. The knowledge of these patterns
				is important because they perturb the usual analysis methods. Last, we believe that the model
				provides a framework which will be general enough for the quantitative exploration of brain
				processes, and maybe for the fusion of fMRI information with data from different modalities. }}}}}

				between the camera and feature points in the scene, noise sensitivity worsens rapidly with
				increasing depth. In this paper, we show that this difficulty can be overcome by computing scene
				geometry directly in terms of shape, that is, by computing the coordinates of feature points in
				the scene with respect to a world-centered system, without recovering camera-centered depth as
				an intermediate quantity. More specifically, we show that a matrix of image measurements can be
				factored by Singular Value Decomposition into the product of two matrices that represent shape
				and motion, respectively."

				not} consider that the calibration parameters are either known or fixed, we develop an
				alternative strategy using the fact that certain class of special displacements induces enough
				equations to evaluate the calibration parameters, so that we can recover the affine or Euclidean
				structure of the scene when needed. A synthesis of what can be recovered for singular
				displacements in terms of camera calibration, scene geometry and kinematics is proposed. We
				give, for the different levels of calibration, an exhaustive list of the geometric and kinematic
				information which can be recovered. Following a strategy based on special kind of displacements,
				such as fixed axis rotations or pure translations for instance, we describe how to detect this
				particular classes of displacement. }

				over long image sequences. We develop a robust estimation framework for improving the
				reliability of motion estimates and an incremental minimization framework for recovering flow
				estimates over time. Attempts to improve the robustness of optical flow have focused on
				detecting and accounting for motion discontinuities in the optical flow field. We show that
				motion discontinuities are one example of a more general class of model violations and that by
				formulating the optical flow problem as one of robust estimation the problems posed by motion
				discontinuities can be reduced, and the violations can be detected. Additionally, robust
				estimation provides a powerful framework for early vision problems that generalizes the popular
				``line process'' approaches. We formulate a temporal continuity constraint, which reflects the
				fact that the motion of a surface changes gradually over time. We exploit this constraint to
				develop a new incremental minimization framework and show how it is related to standard
				recursive estimation techniques. Within this framework we implement two incremental algorithms
				for minimizing non-convex objective functions over time; Incremental Stochastic Minimization
				(ISM) and Incremental Graduated Non-Convexity (IGNC). With this approach, motion estimates are
				always available, they are refined over time, the algorithm adapts to scene changes, and the
				amount of computation between frames is kept fixed. The psychophysical implications of temporal
				continuity are discussed and the power of the incremental minimization framework is demonstrated
				by extending image feature extraction over time. }

				environment using a pair of views obtained with uncalibrated cameras. To be able to execute
				different tasks as a projective reconstruction or computing projective invariants using a pair
				of uncalibrated cameras, it is primordial to know the epipolar geometry, which is perfectly
				characterized by the fundamental matrix. Consequently, the characterization of the uncertainty
				of the fundamental matrix is very important. Therefore, we were studying the possibility to
				estimate this uncertainty using an statistical approach and an analytical one. Knowing the
				epipolar geometry of a pair of views allows us to compute projective invariants of
				three-dimensional objects using only the information found in the two images. So we made a
				detailed study of projective invariants characterizing the different configurations of points or
				plans and/or lines providing also different methods to compute them from the fundamental matrix
				and image measurements. As an indicative example of the application of these invariants, we
				developed implicit methods to compute three-dimensional coordinates from image measurements
				using projective invariants. We compared these methods with the explicit methods of projective
				reconstruction, which are based on estimating the camera matrices and using them to compute the
				three-dimensional coordinates. }

				``reconstructing'' a scene observed from several cameras in 3-D, i.e. to build a description of
				the observed objetcs ans surfaces, and their position in 3-D space. The first problem we
				introduce is the camera calibration problem, where the goal is to compute the camera parameters
				(focal length, optical center, etc.) and their position, either from images of a calibration
				object or automatically (the last case is the so-called self-calibration problem). We present
				new results on self-calibration of optical distortion and on self-calibration of a rigid stereo
				rig from several pairs of images. Then we discuss on image rectification, which simplifies a lot
				the stereo matching problem, and on stereoscopy by correlation, which performs the pointwise
				image matching. We got very good results using some classical methods, and we also developped
				new methods which give a better accuracy. The last step of stereoscopic vision, called the
				reconstruction, gives a 3-D description of a surface and its differential properties up to order
				2 from the results of the correlation methods. Finally, we show a few applications, like a
				system for fusing stereo images with volumetric medical images, and a DIY stereo camera.}

				maps, while preserving the depth discontinuities. In particular in the context of the DEMs
				production of urban areas, with metric resolutions. The correlation-based photogrammetric
				techniques have been shown to be efficient for the computation of dense maps when the hypothesis
				of the continuity of the surface is verified, but produce important errors in the presence of
				large occlusions. As far as geometry-based techniques are concerned, these remain very sparse.
				Since a discontinuity in depth is often characterized by a contrast contour in the 2D-images,
				the basic idea of the CBDL-model is the use of adaptive windows, constrained by the contour
				points extracted from the left and right images. The disparity to be computed being limited to
				an interval , the aim is to find four windows of maximal size (disparity limit) bounded by the
				contour points of the two images, for each possible disparity value in that interval. In the
				context of the creation of the dense map with a resolution in the meter range via CBDL, we can
				improve this method by using an approach of type CBPR applying a pyramidal resolution, which
				allows a faster convergence towards the solution and a spatial consolidation of the dispartity
				map. The introduction of pseudo-reflections allows the application of a Kanade technique.
				Building upon that method, we can extract structural geometric elements (MLD), which will then
				be used to produce a wire-type reconstruction of the building. }

				"symmetries" such as that induced by the projective group action on the luminance field. Besides
				schemes for performing particular user-defined relaxations of the image formation several
				disciplines are considered to help quantise this formation, namely differential and integral
				geometry, classical invariant theory and topology. One of the outcomes is that in order to
				smooth the image formation the best thing to do is to quantise first it in terms of so-called
				integral invariants read out by slot-machines such as the torsion and curvature two-forms. These
				density fields can subsequently relaxed by a connexion induced by themselves. Another
				possibility would be to start a so to spaek topological relaxation of the image formation by
				considering the ridges, ruts and extrema as the only meaningful physical objetcs in the image
				formation. }

				de la pr\'ecision de deux algorithmes de localisation dans des contextes anatomo-fonctionnels
				pr\'ecis. Ces contextes nous ont permis d'introduire dans nos simulations des g\'en\'erateurs
				ayant des caract\'eristiques r\'ealistes sur le plan spatial et sur le plan temporel. La mise en
				\'evidence des propri\'et\'es de notre algorithme spatio-temporel a conduit {\`a} l'optimisation
				de l'interpr\'etation des localisations et {\`a} la mise en place d'un processus de localisation
				non supervis\'e. Dans une seconde partie, nous avons pr\'esent\'e et \'evalu\'e la pr\'ecision

				Nous avons compl\'et\'e l'\'evaluation de notre processus de localisation par deux \'etudes

				une comparaison entre des r\'esultats MEG et des donn\'ees issues d'enregistrements en
				profondeur chez des patients \'epileptiques. La comparaison montre que la MEG donne une image
				fiable de l'ensemble des g\'en\'erateurs impliqu\'es dans une activation, mais peut {\^e}tre
				limit\'ee par sa r\'esolution spatiale. La SEEG est capable de d\'ecrire des d\'etails plus fins
				mais seulement aux sites d'enregistrements. La deuxi{\`e}me \'etude a concern\'e les pointes
				inter-critiques en \'epilepsie chez 7 patients pour lesquels un total de 1400 pointes a \'et\'e
				analys\'e. Nous avons retrouv\'e une tr{\`e}s bonne correspondance entre les enregistrements en
				profondeur et la MEG, particuli{\`e}rement dans les r\'egions sus-sylviennes, m{\^e}me dans des
				cas complexes incluant des recouvrements temporels importants entre sources. La qualit\'e et la

				these features directly from the image. The models associated to each feature include a large
				number of intrinsic parameters (Grey level intensities, location, orientation of the line
				segments\ldots) but also an important parameter which is associated to the blurring effect due
				to the acquisition system. The important problem of the initialization phase in the minimization
				process is also considered and an original and efficient solution is proposed. In order to test
				and compare the reliability, the robustness and the efficiency of the different proposed
				approaches, a large number of experiments involving noisy synthetic data and real images have
				been carried out. Finally, a comparative study of this approach and the classic corner operators
				is presented.}

				been particularly influential in this domain, is the Harris corner detector. The impetus for the
				selection criterion for Harris corners, proposed in early work and which remains in use to this
				day, is based on an intuitive mathematical definition constrained by the need for computational
				parsimony. In this report, we revisit this selection criterion free of the computational
				constraints that existed 20 years ago, and also importantly, taking advantage of the
				regularities observed in natural image statistics. Based on the motivating factors of stability
				and richness of structure, a selection threshold for Harris corners is proposed that is optimal
				with respect to the structure observed in natural images. Following the protocol proposed by
				Mikolajczyk et al. citemiko2005 we demonstrate that the proposed approach produces interest
				points that are more stable across various image deformations and are more distinctive resulting
				in improved matching scores. Finally, the proposal may be shown to generalize to provide an
				improved selection criterion for other types of interest points. As a whole, the report affords
				an improved selection criterion for Harris corners which might foreseeably benefit any system
				that employs Harris corners as a constituent component, and additionally presents a general
				strategy for the selection of interest points based on any measure of local image structure.}

				optimization by gradient flows. Classically, the definition of a gradient depends directly on
				the choice of an inner product structure. This consideration is largely absent from the active
				contours literature. Most authors, explicitely or implicitely, assume that the space of
				admissible deformations is ruled by the canonical $L^2$ inner product. The classical gradient
				flows reported in the literature are relative to this particular choice. Here, we investigate
				the relevance of using (i) other inner products, yielding other gradient descents, and (ii)
				other minimizing flows not deriving from any inner product. In particular, we show how to induce
				different degrees of spatial consistency into the minimizing flow, in order to decrease the
				probability of getting trapped into irrelevant local minima. We report numerical experiments
				indicating that the sensitivity of the active contours method to initial conditions, which
				seriously limits its applicability and efficiency, is alleviated by our application-specific
				spatially coherent minimizing flows. We show that the choice of the inner product can be seen as
				a prior on the deformation fields and we present an extension of the definition of the gradient
				toward more general priors.}

				rotations or pure translations for instance, we also describe how to control the robotic system
				in order to generate these particular classes of displacement. The implementation of these
				equations is analyzed here, and some experimental results are reported. }

				Existing work is based on the use of a calibration pattern whose 3D model is a priori known. We
				show theoretically and with experiments on real images, how it is possible to completely
				calibrate a stereo rig, that is to determine each camera's intrinsic parameters and the relative
				displacement between the two or three cameras, using only point matches obtained during unknown
				motions, without any a priori knowledge of the scenes. The first part of the paper is devoted to
				the computation of the intrinsic parameters of the cameras by a method based upon the estimation
				of the so-called fundamental matrix associated with camera displacement. Three different
				displacements are sufficient to solve the Kruppa equations which yield these parameters. The
				second part of the paper is devoted to the computation of the extrinsic parameters.We first
				explain how to recover the unknown motions previously used, once we have an estimate of the
				intrinsic parameters and the fundamental matrices. The computation is quite robust to the
				inaccuracy of the determination of the camera parameters. We then present the equations which
				allow us, from two displacements of the stereo rig, for which the camera motions are computed
				independently, to compute the relative displacement between the cameras. This technique allows
				us to compute the relative displacement between two or three cameras and complete the full
				calibration of the rig.}

				problem of where to place the cameras in order to obtain a minimal error in the 3D measurements,
				also called {\it camera network design} in photogrammetry. We pose the problem in terms of an
				optimization design, dividingit into two main components: 1) an analytical part dedicated to the
				analysis oferror propagation from which a criterion is derived, 2) a global optimization process
				to minimizes this criterion. In this way, the approach consists of an uncertainty analysis
				applied to the reconstruction process from which a covariance matrix is computed. This matrix
				represents the uncertainty of the detection from which the criterion is derived. Moreover, the
				optimization has discontinuities mainly due to the unobser\-vability of points, which leads to a
				combinatorial optimization process. These aspects are solved using a multicellular genetic
				algorithm. Experimental results are provided to illustrate the effectiveness and efficiency of
				the solution. }

				compare a number of the available methods. Projective stereo algorithms can be categorized by
				the way in which the 3D coordinates are computed. The first class is similar to traditional
				stereo algorithms in that the 3D world geometry is made explicit; the initial phase of the
				processing always involves the estimation of the camera matrices from which the 3D coordinates
				are computed. We show how the camera matrices can be computed either from point correspondences,
				or how they are constrained by the fundamental matrices. The second class of algorithms are
				based on implicit image measurements which are used to compute projective invariants from image
				correspondences. The invariants are based on the Cayley algebra and on cross ratios. In all
				cases, the invariants are functionally dependent on the 3D coordinates. We report on the
				stabilities of the different methods using a range of meaningful synthetic and real images. From
				these we can conclude which methods are most likely to be of use in applications that are

				Projective invariants are derived for two classes of object: the first is for points that lie on

				incomplete and erroneous topological relations, such as the image projection of polyhedral

				edge detection should not be carried out in isolation. The resulting topological and geometric
				descriptions should be motivated by the subsequent representations to be built on such image
				features. Here, algorithm development is driven by general object recognition, which provides an
				objective evaluation of the resulting edgel structure. In effect, we test the design by

				However, they treated only four degree of freedom objects (dof.), and not polyhedra in general.
				We extend their results to arbitrary dof. figures by showing that more complex shapes can be
				broken down into sets of connected four dof. polyhedra. Although the more general shapes do not
				possess projective properties as a whole (when viewed by a single camera), each subpart does
				yield a projective description. Furthermore, planar projective invariants can be measured which
				link together the subparts. Consequently, we are able to provide local-global descriptions for
				general trihedral polyhedra. The original projective description also involved a difficult
				mathematical analysis. We demonstrate that a set of {\em butterfly invariants} can be used in
				equivalence to the original formulation. We also provide a novel algebraic formulation of the
				butterfly invariant which is simpler both to implement and to understand than previous
				approaches. We therefore provide a more straightforward route to the computation of polyhedral
				invariants. Finally, we demonstrate the recovery of polyhedral shape descriptions from images by
				exploiting the local-global nature of the invariants. Local measures can be extracted far more
				reliably in real images due to the problems of feature segmentation. Additionally, with the aid

				can start to infer that the model hypothesis is incorrect. Similar reasoning can be used to
				exploit image topology and the uniqueness of sets of model-image correspondences. Generally,
				such a line of thinking departs from traditional approaches in which topological interactions
				between features are not exploited fully. Testing out our algorithms for topology and occlusion
				analysis has involved the implementation of a complete object recognition system. The system we

				posture, eye movements, visual research, ... All require a motion percept to operate. At the

				on a sufficient level to react correctly. In this report we present a model of motion
				integration and segmentation in the first visual cortex areas. Specifically we modeled the first
				two cortex areas involved in motion processing in the primate: V1 and MT. To be able to process
				motion correctly a visual system also need to deal with form information. We investigate how
				form cues coming from the ventral pathway can be used by the V1/MT dorsal pathway to solve some
				perception problems. By using a recurrent dynamical system between the V1 and MT layers we are
				able to find out psychophysical results such as motion integration and center-surround effects
				due to the feedback connections, or end-of-line and 2D features detectors thanks to the shunting
				inhibition. We propose to modulate this system by a form information coming from the ventral
				stream and are thus able to explain asymmetric center-surround effects as well as motion
				segmentation and segregation between extrinsic and intrinsic junctions.}

				processing can be incorporated in a dynamical model to solve several aspects of 2D motion
				integration and segmentation. Our model is inspired by the hierarchical processing stages of the
				primate visual cortex: we describe the interactions between several layers processing local
				motion and form information through feedforward, feedback, and inhibitive lateral connections.
				Also, following perceptual studies concerning contour integration and physiological studies of
				receptive fields, we postulate that motion estimation takes advantage of another low level cue,
				which is luminance smoothness along edges or surfaces, in order to gate recurrent motion
				diffusion. With such a model, we successfully reproduced the temporal dynamics of motion
				integration on a wide range of simple motion stimuli: line segments, rotating ellipses, plaids,
				and barber poles. Furthermore, we showed that the proposed computational rule of luminance-gated
				diffusion of motion information is sufficient to explain a large set of contextual modulations
				of motion integration and segmentation in more elaborated stimuli such as chopstick illusions,
				simulated aperture problems, or rotating diamonds. As a whole, in this paper we proposed a new
				basal luminance-driven motion integration mechanism as an alternative to less parsimonious
				models, we carefully investigated the dynamics of motion integration, and we established a
				distinction between simple and complex stimuli according to the kind of information required to
				solve their ambiguities.},

				with an artificial retina model, delivering spikes to higher-level visual tasks simulations. The
				architecture of our retina model is based on recent physiological studies, so that each feature
				is related to real retina characteristics. The model includes a linear filtering process,
				followed by a static non-linearity, and then a spike generation process. It thus simulates the
				output of the Parvocellular pathway of primate retinas, possibly for large-scale simulations.
				Two series of tests were performed: firstly on single cells for which ground truth is available,
				secondly on realistic visual scenes. The report sets the basis for further modeling. This
				includes nonlinear effects that could occur due to the conductance-based nature of synaptic
				interactions. Another future extension is modeling of the Magnocellular pathway of primate
				retinas. It is our conviction that building such a bio-inspired model will help in better
				understanding how the retina performs and also in relating observations to biological
				mechanisms.}

				projections consists of two stages: (i) using the 8-point algorithm to estimate the 9 essential
				parameters defined up to a scale factor, which is a linear estimation problem; (ii) refining the
				motion estimation based on some statistically optimal criteria, which is a nonlinear estimation
				problem on a five-dimensional space. Unfortunately, the results obtained using this approach are
				often not satisfactory, especially when the motion is small or when the observed points are
				close to a degenerate surface (e.g. plane). The problem is that the second stage is very
				sensitive to the initial guess, and that it is very difficult to obtain a precise initial
				estimate from the first stage. This is because we perform a projection of a set of quantities
				which are estimated in a space of 8 dimensions, much higher than that of the real space which is
				five-dimensional. We propose in this paper a novel approach by introducing an intermediate stage
				which consists in estimating a $3 3$ matrix defined up to a scale factor by imposing the
				\emph{zero-determinant constraint} (the matrix has seven independent parameters, and is known as
				the fundamental matrix). The idea is to \emph{gradually} project parameters estimated in a high
				dimensional space onto a \emph{slightly lower} space, namely from 8 dimensions to 7 and finally
				to 5. The proposed approach has been tested with synthetic and real data, and a considerable
				improvement has been observed for the delicate situations mentioned above. Our conjecture from
				this work is that the imposition of the constraints arising from projective geometry should be
				used as an intermediate step in order to obtain reliable 3D Euclidean motion and structure
				estimation from multiple calibrated images.}

				object depends on viewpoint. This problem is entirely avoided if the geometric description is
				unaffected by the imaging transformation. Such invariant descriptions can be measured from
				images without without any prior knowledge of the position, orientation and calibration of the
				camera. These invariant measures can be used to index a library of object models for recognition
				and provide a principled basis for the other stages of the recognition process such as feature
				groping and hypothesis verification. Object models can be acquired directly from images,
				allowing efficient construction of model libraries without manual intervention. A significant
				part of the paper is a summary of recent results on the construction of invariants for 3D
				objects from a single perspective view. A proposed recognition architecture is described which
				enables the integration of multiple general object classes and provides a means for enforcing
				global scene consistency. Various criticisms of the invariant approach are articulated and
				addressed.}

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Spike-frequency adaptation is a prominent feature of neural dynamics.
   Among other mechanisms, various ionic currents modulating spike
   generation cause this type of neural adaptation. Prominent examples are
   voltage-gated potassium currents (M-type currents), the interplay of
   calcium currents and intracellular calcium dynamics with calcium-gated
   potassium channels (AHP-type currents), and the slow recovery from
   inactivation of the fast sodium current. While recent modeling studies
   have focused on the effects of specific adaptation currents, we derive
   a universal model for the firing-frequency dynamics of an adapting
   neuron that is independent of the specific adaptation process and spike
   generator. The model is completely defined by the neuron's onset f-I
   curve, the steadystate f-I curve, and the time constant of adaptation.
   For a specific neuron, these parameters can be easily determined from
   electrophysiological measurements without any pharmacological
   manipulations. At the same time, the simplicity of the model allows one
   to analyze mathematically how adaptation influences signal processing
   on the single-neuron level. In particular, we elucidate the specific
   nature of high-pass filter properties caused by spike-frequency
   adaptation. The model is limited to firing frequencies higher than the
   reciprocal adaptation time constant and to moderate fluctuations of the
   adaptation and the input current. As an extension of the model, we
   introduce a framework for combining an arbitrary spike generator with a
   generalized adaptation current.},

    abstract = {{Computational neuroscience uses mathematical models to study how neural systems represent and transmit information. Although modeling in computational neuroscience spans a range of mathematical approaches, the discipline may be divided approximately into two schools. The first school uses detailed biophysical (Hodgkin and Huxley and their variants) models of individual neurons, networks of neurons or artificial neural network models to study emergent behaviors of neural systems. The second school, and the one we discuss here, develops signal processing algorithms and statistical methods to analyze the ever-growing volumes of data collected in neuroscience experiments. The growing complexity of neuroscience experiments makes use of appropriate data analysis methods crucial for establishing how reliably specific system properties can be identified from experimental measurements. In particular, careful data analysis is an essential complement to neural network modeling; it allows validation of neural network model predictions in addition to feeding back biologically relevant constraints and parameter values for further analytic and simulation studies. Neuroscience experiments and neural spike train data have special features that present new, exciting challenges for statistical research.}},

Abstract = {Oscillations in many regions of the cortex have common temporal
   characteristics with dominant frequencies centered around the 40 Hz
   (gamma) frequency range and the 5-10 Hz (theta) frequency range.
   Experimental results also reveal spatially synchronous oscillations,
   which are stimulus dependent (Gray \& Singer,1987; Gray, Konig, Engel,
   \& Singer, 1989; Engel, Konig, Kreiter, Schillen, \& Singer, 1992).
   This rhythmic activity suggests that the coherence of neural
   populations is a crucial feature of cortical dynamics (Gray, 1994).
   Using both simulations and a theoretical coupled oscillator approach,
   we demonstrate that the spike frequency adaptation seen in many
   pyramidal cells plays a subtle but important role in the dynamics of
   cortical networks. Without adaptation, excitatory connections among
   model pyramidal cells are desynchronizing. However, the slow processes
   associated with adaptation encourage stable synchronous behavior.},

The instability persists in the presence of a magnetic field.

Abstract = {There are several different biophysical mechanisms for spike frequency
   adaptation observed in recordings from cortical neurons. The two most
   commonly used in modeling studies are a calcium-dependent potassium
   current I-ahp and a slow voltage-dependent potassium current, I-m. We
   show that both of these have strong effects on the synchronization
   properties of excitatorily coupled neurons. Furthermore, we show that
   the reasons for these effects are different. We show through an
   analysis of some standard models, that the M-current adaptation alters
   the mechanism for repetitive firing, while the afterhyperpolarization
   adaptation works via shunting the incoming synapses. This latter
   mechanism applies with a network that has recurrent inhibition. The
   shunting behavior is captured in a simple two-variable reduced model
   that arises near certain types of bifurcations. A one-dimensional map
   is derived from the simplified model.},

Almost all spike sequences converge within a finite number of transient spikes to these attractors. The convergence is fast, especially when the global inhibition is strong. These results support the possibility that precise spatiotemporal sequences of spikes are useful for information encoding and processing in biological neural networks.},

@article{jin:08,
    abstract = {Temporally complex stimuli are encoded into spatiotemporal spike sequences of neurons in many sensory areas. Here, we describe how downstream neurons with dendritic bistable plateau potentials can be connected to decode such spike sequences. Driven by feedforward inputs from the sensory neurons and controlled by feedforward inhibition and lateral excitation, the neurons transit between {UP} and {DOWN} states of the membrane potentials. The neurons spike only in the {UP} states. A decoding neuron spikes at the end of an input to signal the recognition of specific spike sequences. The transition dynamics is equivalent to that of a finite state automaton. A connection rule for the networks guarantees that any finite state automaton can be mapped into the transition dynamics, demonstrating the equivalence in computational power between the networks and finite state automata. The decoding mechanism is capable of recognizing an arbitrary number of spatiotemporal spike sequences, and is insensitive 
to the variations of the spike timings in the sequences.},

  abstract = {The response of a neuron to synaptic input strongly depends on whether or not the neuron has just emitted a spike. We propose a neuron model that after spike emission exhibits a partial response to residual input charges and study its collective network dynamics analytically. We uncover a desynchronization mechanism that causes a sequential desynchronization transition: In globally coupled neurons an increase in the strength of the partial response induces a sequence of bifurcations from states with large clusters of synchronously firing neurons, through states with smaller clusters to completely asynchronous spiking. We briefly discuss key consequences of this mechanism for more general networks of biophysical neurons.

    abstract = {{Recent work has examined the estimation of models of stimulus-driven neural activity in which some linear filtering process is followed by a nonlinear, probabilistic spiking stage. We analyze the estimation of one such model for which this nonlinear step is implemented by a known parametric function; the assumption that this function is known speeds the estimation process considerably. We investigate the shape of the likelihood function for this type of model, give a simple condition on the nonlinearity ensuring that no non-global local maxima exist in the likelihood—leading, in turn, to efficient algorithms for the computation of the maximum likelihood estimator—and discuss the implications for the form of the allowed nonlinearities. Finally, we note some interesting connections between the likelihood-based estimators and the classical spike-triggered average estimator, discuss some useful extensions of the basic model structure, and provide two novel applications to physiological data.}},

@article{pillow-ahmadian-etal:11,
    abstract = {{Stimulus reconstruction or decoding methods provide an important tool for understanding how sensory and motor information is represented in neural activity. We discuss Bayesian decoding methods based on an encoding generalized linear model (GLM) that accurately describes how stimuli are transformed into the spike trains of a group of neurons. The form of the GLM likelihood ensures that the posterior distribution over the stimuli that caused an observed set of spike trains is log concave so long as the prior is. This allows the maximum a posteriori (MAP) stimulus estimate to be obtained using efficient optimization algorithms. Unfortunately, the MAP estimate can have a relatively large average error when the posterior is highly nongaussian. Here we compare several Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms that allow for the calculation of general Bayesian estimators involving posterior expectations (conditional on model parameters). An efficient version of the hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithm was significantly superior to other MCMC methods for gaussian priors. When the prior distribution has sharp edges and corners, on the other hand, the ?hit-and-run? algorithm performed better than other MCMC methods. Using these algorithms, we show that for this latter class of priors, the posterior mean estimate can have a considerably lower average error than MAP, whereas for gaussian priors, the two estimators have roughly equal efficiency. We also address the application of MCMC methods for extracting nonmarginal properties of the posterior distribution. For example, by using MCMC to calculate the mutual information between the stimulus and response, we verify the validity of a computationally efficient Laplace approximation to this quantity for gaussian priors in a wide range of model parameters; this makes direct model-based computation of the mutual information tractable even in the case of large observed neural populations, where methods based on binning the spike train fail. Finally, we consider the effect of uncertainty in the GLM parameters on the posterior estimators.}},

The general solution for STRF estimation requires normalization of the stimulus-response cross-correlation by the stimulus auto-correlation matrix. When the second-order stimulus statistics are stationary, normalization involves only the diagonal elements of the Fourier-transformed auto-correlation matrix (the power spectrum). In the non-stationary case normalization requires the entire auto-correlation matrix. We present modelling studies that demonstrate the feasibility and accuracy of this method as well as neurophysiological data comparing STRFs estimated using natural versus synthetic stimulus ensembles. For both auditory and visual neurons, STRFs obtained with these different stimuli are similar, but exhibit systematic differences that may be functionally significant. This method should be useful for determining what aspects of natural signals are represented by sensory neurons and may reveal novel response properties of these neurons.

	abstract = {Pattern recognition is one of the most important tasks of the visual system, and uncovering the neural mechanisms underlying recognition phenomena has been a focus of researchers for decades. Surprisingly, at the earliest stages of vision, the retina is capable of highly sophisticated temporal pattern recognition. We stimulated the retina of tiger salamander (Ambystoma tigrinum) with periodic dark flash sequences and found that retinal ganglion cells had a wide variety of different responses to a periodic flash sequence with many firing when a flash was omitted. The timing of the omitted stimulus response (OSR) depended on the period, with individual cells tracking the stimulus period down to increments of 5 ms. When flashes occurred earlier than expected, cells updated their expectation of the next flash time by as much as 50 ms. When flashes occurred later than expected, cells fired an OSR and reset their temporal expectation to the average time interval between flashes. Using pharmacology to investigate the retinal circuitry involved, we found that inhibitory transmission from amacrine cells was not required, but on bipolar cells were required. The results suggest a mechanism in which the intrinsic resonance of on bipolars leads to the OSR in ganglion cells. We discuss the implications of retinal pattern recognition on the neural code of the retina and visual processing in general.},

This burst can be driven by either the leading or trailing edge of the object. The latency is constant for movement at different speeds, objects of different size, and bright versus dark contrasts. The same ganglion cells that signal a motion reversal also respond to smooth motion. We show that the brain can build a pure reversal detector using only a linear filter that reads out synchrony from a group of ganglion cells. These results indicate that not only can the retina anticipate the location of a smoothly moving object, but that it can also signal violations in its own prediction. We show that the reversal response cannot be explained by models of the classical receptive field and suggest that nonlinear receptive field subunits may be responsible.}},

@article{uvriss:Searle80,
    abstract = {{This article can be viewed as an attempt to explore the consequences of two propositions. (1) Intentionality in human beings (and animals) is a product of causal features of the brain. I assume this is an empirical fact about the actual causal relations between mental processes and brains. It says simply that certain brain processes are sufficient for intentionality. (2) Instantiating a computer program is never by itself a sufficient condition of intentionality. The main argument of this paper is directed at establishing this claim. The form of the argument is to show how a human agent could instantiate the program and still not have the relevant intentionality. These two propositions have the following consequences: (3) The explanation of how the brain produces intentionality cannot be that it does it by instantiating a computer program. This is a strict logical consequence of 1 and 2. (4) Any mechanism capable of producing intentionality must have causal powers equal to those of the brain. This is meant to be a trivial consequence of 1. (5) Any attempt literally to create intentionality artificially (strong AI) could not succeed just by designing programs but would have to duplicate the causal powers of the human brain. This follows from 2 and 4. ” Could a machine think?” On the argument advanced here only a machine could think, and only very special kinds of machines, namely brains and machines with internal causal powers equivalent to those of brains. And that is why strong AI has little to tell us about thinking, since it is not about machines but about programs, and no program by itself is sufficient for thinking.}},

A strong test of this hypothesis is to require a computational model of the basal ganglia to generate integrated selection sequences in an autonomous agent, we therefore describe a robot architecture into which such a model is embedded, and require it to control action selection in a robotic task inspired by animal observations. Our results demonstrate effective action selection by the embedded model under a wide range of sensory and motivational conditions. When confronted with multiple, high salience alternatives, the robot also exhibits forms of behavioral disintegration that show similarities to animal behavior in conflict situations. The model is shown to cast light on recent neurobiological findings concerning behavioral switching and sequencing.}},

    abstract = {{This paper describes a free energy principle that tries to explain the ability of biological systems to resist a natural tendency to disorder. It appeals to circular causality of the sort found in synergetic formulations of self-organization (e.g., the slaving principle) and models of coupled dynamical systems, using nonlinear Fokker Planck equations. Here, circular causality is induced by separating the states of a random dynamical system into external and internal states, where external states are subject to random fluctuations and internal states are not. This reduces the problem to finding some (deterministic) dynamics of the internal states that ensure the system visits a limited number of external states; in other words, the measure of its (random) attracting set, or the Shannon entropy of the external states is small. We motivate a solution using a principle of least action based on variational free energy (from statistical physics) and establish the conditions under which it is formally equivalent to the information bottleneck method. This approach has proved useful in understanding the functional architecture of the brain. The generality of variational free energy minimisation and corresponding information theoretic formulations may speak to interesting applications beyond the neurosciences; e.g., in molecular or evolutionary biology.}},

    abstract = {{This paper considers agency in the setting of embodied or active inference. In brief, we associate a sense of agency with prior beliefs about action and ask what sorts of beliefs underlie optimal behavior. In particular, we consider prior beliefs that action minimizes the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between desired states and attainable states in the future. This allows one to formulate bounded rationality as approximate Bayesian inference that optimizes a free energy bound on model evidence. We show that constructs like expected utility, exploration bonuses, softmax choice rules and optimism bias emerge as natural consequences of this formulation. Previous accounts of active inference have focused on predictive coding and Bayesian filtering schemes for minimizing free energy. Here, we consider variational Bayes as an alternative scheme that provides formal constraints on the computational anatomy of inference and action-constraints that are remarkably consistent with neuroanatomy. Furthermore, this scheme contextualizes optimal decision theory and economic (utilitarian) formulations as pure inference problems. For example, expected utility theory emerges as a special case of free energy minimization, where the sensitivity or inverse temperature (of softmax functions and quantal response equilibria) has a unique and Bayes-optimal solution-that minimizes free energy. This sensitivity corresponds to the precision of beliefs about behavior, such that attainable goals are afforded a higher precision or confidence. In turn, this means that optimal behavior entails a representation of confidence about outcomes that are under an agent's control.}},

    abstract = {{We offer a formal treatment of choice behavior based on the premise that agents minimize the expected free energy of future outcomes. Crucially, the negative free energy or quality of a policy can be decomposed into extrinsic and epistemic (or intrinsic) value. Minimizing expected free energy is therefore equivalent to maximizing extrinsic value or expected utility (defined in terms of prior preferences or goals), while maximizing information gain or intrinsic value (or reducing uncertainty about the causes of valuable outcomes). The resulting scheme resolves the exploration-exploitation dilemma: Epistemic value is maximized until there is no further information gain, after which exploitation is assured through maximization of extrinsic value. This is formally consistent with the Infomax principle, generalizing formulations of active vision based upon salience (Bayesian surprise) and optimal decisions based on expected utility and risk-sensitive (Kullback-Leibler) control. Furthermore, as with previous active inference formulations of discrete (Markovian) problems, ad hoc softmax parameters become the expected (Bayes-optimal) precision of beliefs about, or confidence in, policies. This article focuses on the basic theory, illustrating the ideas with simulations. A key aspect of these simulations is the similarity between precision updates and dopaminergic discharges observed in conditioning paradigms.}},
