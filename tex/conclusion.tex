We consider another formulation of weight estimation in recurrent networks, proposing a notation for a large amount of recurrent network units that helps formulating the estimation problem. Reusing a ``good old'' control-theory principle, improved here using a continuation heuristic, we obtain a numerically stable and rather efficient second-order and distributed estimation, without any meta-parameter to adjust. The relation with existing technique is discussed at each step. 
The proposed method is validated using reverse engineering tasks and non-trivial numerical computations.
